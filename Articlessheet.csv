"The continuing demolitions in Wadi Hummus, and most recently the case of Khirbet Humsa, underline the need to create additional tools to put at the disposal of Palestinians to better record and then challenge the damage being wrought upon them. They reinforce the need to document and expose the costs of colonisation on the international stage. This should go beyond measuring just the transactional economic costs on gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national income (GNI) of the Israeli occupation, which the World Bank is already doing because such economy-focused efforts ignore the human context.


The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA) recently took important steps to document and expose the real cost of Israel’s colonialism and occupation. Yet, these efforts need to be expanded. This includes reaching out to more of the countless Palestinian analysts who are better equipped to measure these costs than outside experts. Efforts to document and expose all costs of Israel’s colonialism should also include recording and sharing the personalised experiences of its victims. Any accounting that ignores the psychological and emotional scars, just because they are difficult to translate into numbers, or uncomfortable to acknowledge, will remain short-sighted and ineffective.

This information can be used to slow colonialism’s impact and plan out a future recovery. It is critical to stress this will need to be accompanied by action by the international community to put a stop to further displacement and replacement. That step is also the only possible way to finally establish the conditions for Palestinians to build institutions, foster a stable economy and improve their social wellbeing. This is also imperative because colonisation should not be normalised, sponsored or sustained in a world governed by international law. Ending Israel’s displacement and replacement paradigm is critical to regional peace and stability, too.

Rather than holding Israel to account for its ongoing colonisation of Palestine, the international community’s most powerful actors are choosing to justify and rationalise its crimes against Palestinians. As a result, Israeli policies that blatantly violate human rights and international law are starting to be perceived as “normal” and even “righteous”. Colonisation is one of the most easily recognised forms of oppression in the world. However, to this day, the international community never truly acknowledged the colonial nature of Israel’s occupation and allowed it to violate international law with impunity.

The US has listed Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan as huge money-laundering jurisdictions in the Basel AML Index. The index ranks money laundering and terrorist financing risks around the world.


George Monbiot, writing for ‘The Guardian’, states that Jason Hickel points out in his book ‘The Divide’, theft by officials in poorer nations amounts to between $20 billion and $40 billion a year. But this figure is dwarfed by the illicit flows of money from poor and middling nations that are organized by multinational companies and banks. The US research group Global Financial Integrity estimates that $1.1 trillion a year flows illegally out of poorer nations stolen from them through tax evasion and the transfer of money within corporations.

The irony is that these developed countries call out developing nations for corruption but never accept their part in enabling this corruption. Often these are countries where kleptocrats seek refuge after laundering millions at the expense of the poor taxpayer.

Money laundering would not be possible without the big banks, lenient company registration laws, and lawyers for protection that these countries have to offer.

FATF, Basel AML Index, and Transparency International are all products of these developed rich countries. These products fail to highlight this corruption enablement industry and how much money the industry makes by enabling money-laundering. They do not give out rankings for the top ten corruption-enabling countries. Neither do we see FATF crippling the G7 by putting them on a grey or black list if they do not clean up their house with regard to the enablement industry.

Ronojit Banerjee, who writes about money laundering in the EU, states that in this competitive world, bank officials are under increasing pressure to bring in new business and increase profits. Indeed, it is suggested that the only reason why many Western banks stay afloat is because of the money laundering services they offer and perform. This can be exemplified by the case of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). In this case, the bank needed to earn profits to cover up the huge losses from loans and trading and the simple solution of money laundering provided an easy way of doing this.

The second conflict is that certain banks and countries have a competitive advantage in providing private banking services – client confidentiality. Bank secrecy laws exist in fifty nations around the world and for such banks, this is a necessity for attracting clients. Any moves to abolish or continually override such laws are likely to be strongly opposed.

Oliver Bullough in his article titled, ‘How Britain can help you get away with stealing millions: a five-step guide’, states that when it comes to financial crime, Britain is your best friend. Oliver states that if you want to create an impenetrable weapon for committing fraud: first, forget about the supposed offshore centers and come to the UK; then take advantage of the super-easy Companies House web portal; then enter false information, and finally, make sure that information is plausible enough to deceive a casual observer. The fifth step is not to worry as there is not much oversight as hardly anyone has ever been held accountable.

So, what exactly can Pakistan do to combat money-laundering apart from what it is already doing?

First is the foreign policy front, since we are trying to invest in improving our soft image. Our foreign policy should make room to highlight Pakistani kleptocrats that have laundered money and have established assets in these corruption-enabling countries. The foreign ministry should work, with its counterparts in these enabling countries, to collect more data on the dealings of these kleptocrats. Then we can highlight how much has been looted from the taxpayers and brought into these enabling countries.

Furthermore, we should contribute resources to the exposition of kleptocrats around the world. Doing so will show that we are a responsible country that is not only bent on rooting kleptocracy from its ranks but also other countries. Pakistan should work with other governments against this international enablement industry to prevent the layering of money by exposing the enablers. We should also work with the banks of these countries to blacklist known kleptocrats and their allies so they cannot use these banks again.

Second, our foreign policy should also accommodate and work with key government figures who propose plans to fight global financial corruption. Senator Elizabeth Warren of the US is one such figure; in her plan, she has proposed collecting standardized identifying information about the ultimate beneficial ownership of every corporate entity created across the US. To increase understanding of the web of companies operating in the US and help to end America’s status as a global facilitator of money laundering. Even though, it would be unconventional to make an individual ally like Senator Warren, in the long term an ally like Senator Warren can help us in other foreign policy endeavours as well.

Lastly, things we can do at the home front: we should amend the Extradition Act 1972 to include money laundering as an extraditable offence. The present government, instead of hopeful statements, should double down on its effort to make extradition treaties with countries like the UK and UAE. It is common knowledge that the UK and UAE seem to be a hotbed for Pakistanis who launder money, and as their go-to places for refuge.

The present government and those who come into power later should reform the image of NAB as a political tool and ensure that it operates without any political bias and or agenda. Believe it or not, there is actual work to do instead of shouting about punishing corrupt leaders. This work involves closing existing loopholes leading to money-laundering. The government did take this initiative by deciding to repeal the Protection of Economic Reforms Act (PERA) of 1992 and the Foreign Private Investment Act of 1976. However, nothing has transpired. The government urgently needs to do better on the delivery front and to work on staying consistent with its promises.

Sections 5 and 9 of the PERA and Section 111(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance guarantee immunity from disclosing the source of assets. It is loopholes like these that need to be closed. It would also be of importance to note that Section 111(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance enables whitening black money through foreign remittances. It would be in our best interest to get rid of such enablements in the law.

In conclusion, as James Crabtree, author of ‘Billionaire Raj’, says: there is a double standard in the way we view corruption in the world. People look at countries like India and say these are corrupt countries; however, this corruption would not be possible without seemingly respectable international finance. Money launderers need international banks to funnel money abroad, international lawyers, tax havens to host shell companies. So, the grand corruption we see in countries like India works hand in glove with a more anonymous form of corruption. This corruption is created in rich countries like Britain or Switzerland and or America.

Accountability should be across the board and as important as it is to rid Pakistan of corruption; countries which enable corruption should share the blame equally with us.

"Today, in a world where food worth more than $1 trillion is lost or wasted every year, more than 800 million people are hungry. And the Covid-19 pandemic has only made the problem worse. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), one-third of food produced for human consumption worldwide is annually lost or wasted along the chain that stretches from farms to processing plants, marketplaces, retailers, food-service operations, and our households. And there are many factors that contribute to food loss including limitations on crop production and other resource-saving agricultural techniques, inadequate transport and storage infrastructures, changing climate and excess purchases and portions.

Surprisingly, the proportion of food produced but not consumed within developing and developed nations are similar. However, the reasons for food waste in developed and developing countries are significantly different.

In developing countries, food waste happens during food production and is mainly due to climate-induced crop failures and inadequate infrastructures to transport food to the market and to store it once it is produced. By contrast, in the developed world, food is wasted mainly due to consumers buying or cooking more food than they need. In addition, according to a 2016 survey by the Harvard Food Law and Policy clinic, many consumers throw away perfectly good food because of confusing expiry date labels.

Despite most of the wastage taking place at the very end of the value chain, developed countries contribute significantly to global food waste. In the US, approximately 36 million tonnes of food – between 30-40 percent of the food supply – is wasted every year. In the UK, households waste 4.5 million tonnes of food each year. In Australia, nearly 7.3 million tonnes of food is wasted.

Associated with food waste are the economic costs that arise from the resources used to produce food. Farmers, for example, use 1.8 billion pounds of nitrogen fertiliser and 1.5 billion pounds of phosphorous fertiliser annually to grow wasted crops while applying more than 750 million pounds of pesticide to protect food that often ends up wasted. According to FAO, “direct economic consequences of food wastage (excluding fish and seafood) run to the tune of $750bn annually”.

All these depressing statistics can lead people to think individual actions would not make a difference. In the fight against food waste, however, everyone’s contribution matters.

So what can individuals, businesses, organisations, and corporations do to stop food waste? In developed countries, where consumers are responsible for most of the waste, every single person can play an important role in turning the tide. Simply by not buying more food than they can eat, consumers in the developed world can help significantly reduce food waste in their countries. Buying locally produced food, which does not face the risk of being spoiled during transport, can also help.

"The federal government’s decision to establish an Island Authority through a presidential ordinance has continued to spark protests by Sindh’s nationalist and mainstream parties for the past two months.


The protest rally in Karachi over the weekend on Sunday, November 15 by the major alliance Sindh Action Committee, comprising Sindh-based parties outside parliamentary politics, saw a huge turnout of participants not seen since the 2018 elections. The island issue has galvanized the nationalist parties’ base.

Nationalists who did not do well in the general polls are now able to thrive on popular sentiment against the federal ordinance which was issued in secrecy, in complete absence of public debate, and it caught people by surprise when it surfaced in August. The ordinance was seen as an attempt to annex Sindh and Balochistan’s islands on their coastline, which under the existing Pakistan’s constitution fall under provincial jurisdiction.

In question are two major islands on Karachi’s coast, the Bundal and Buddoo islands. Spread over 12, 000 acres of land, these islands are home to mangroves and a natural defence line against cyclones and oceanic waves. If allowed to develop, the islands' city will be bigger than the present DHA in Karachi which is spread over 9,000 acres.

The fact is that the already rich civil and military bureaucracy does not face a housing shortage; it is the poorer sections of society across the country that lack access to affordable housing.

The ordinance, issued in August, has already landed in the Sindh High Court where the federal attorney general during the first hearing of the case admitted that ‘the islands are the property of the province’. This simple admission of the fact takes away ground for the federal government’s attempts to take away provincial resources for the commercial exploitation purposes.

The kind of overwhelming reaction that this ordinance has invited has come from four different stakeholders within Sindh. The most prominent political response came from the PPP, which rules Sindh, and also from Functional League MPAs. One lone PTI member of the Sindh Assembly from Ghotki, MPA Shahreyar Shar’s emotional speech has gone viral on social media platforms. Other PTI Sindhi-speaking elected officials have come under severe criticism and appear to be cornered. The PTI as a party does not seem to care much about losing its Sindhi vote bank in Badin, Jacobabad and Ghotki. Civil rights lawyer Shahab Usto, petitioner in this case, finds the Sindh Assembly resolution to be providing impetus and further legal grounds to his case in the court.

The second voice of reason has come from Karachi-based environmentalists, who rightly fear that the commercial development of islands will create long-lasting ecological problems for the delta, as both islands serve as a natural wall against cyclones, tsunamis. The islands have nearly 3,500 hectares of mangroves, and are part of the Indus delta, declared a protected area under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance to which Pakistan is a signatory

The island project deprives local fishermen access to these islands and their fishing routes and access to the open sea, thus stealing away their livelihood. This is yet another case of how Pakistan’s disempowered working class people are dispossessed of their resources and means of survival. The fishermen and women are the third force against the islands’ commercial development. Thousands of fishermen families have been living in abject poverty because they have no alternative to economic options. The commercial development of these islands will dislocate the fisherfolk – and this is why the fiercest protest is being held and led by these communities and their representative bodies like the Pakistan Fisher Folk Forum.

The ordinance has added a fresh impetus to Sindh’s grievances in Pakistan’s unequal federation at a time when close to a hundred activists associated with various Sindhi political parties are missing, some even for years. There is resentment and rage against these disappearances; families of missing persons have been protesting for years without any results, and their painful ordeal and cries go unheard. A general sense of helplessness has deepened in Sindhi society because of these issues.

Overseas Sindhis have largely remained aloof from protest movements in Sindh, but the island takeover – and abduction of citizens – has alarmed them. These signs of discontent should be enough to wake up Pakistan’s unelected elements that call the shots and plan such unpopular policies in violation of the laws of the land.

Nationalist parties, which find it hard to win elections, now seem to have captured the opportunity and are radicalizing people around their narrative. Both the issues of island annexation and missing persons fit into their narrative of how Sindh and the Sindhi people are subject to state highhandedness and resource grab. The federal government and others who call the shots appear to be unmoved by these waves of the protest. If one listens to the political sermons of Syed Jalal Shah, Qader Magsi, Ayaz Latif Palijo and JSQM Chairman Sanan Qureshi, it is not hard to figure out where Sindh is headed – more political unrest and a deepening sense of deprivation which eventually could fuel dangerous divisions.

Activists, media and the civil society do not see this grab of the islands as a stand-alone issue, rather a process of overpowering the will of the people, and taking over their lawful right over their resources, and eventually paving the way for turning them into a minority in their historical province. These vocal voices cannot buy the development lollipop which does not include them, and tactically changes the ownership of the islands, and in-effect takes away territorial part of the province. This will have far more serious consequences for harmony, trust and coexistence in the country. Is it worth pursuing such self-serving development? And at what cost?",negative
"PESHAWAR: Afghanistan on Friday closed its consulate here in protest following a dispute pertaining to the ownership of a market in the city.


The Supreme Court had earlier given its verdict in favour of a Pakistani citizen who claimed ownership of the building in Peshawar that is also claimed by the Afghan government. Afghan Consul General Mohammad Hashim Niazi maintained that the Afghan flag has been removed from the market owned by Afghanistan.

He alleged that the shopkeepers in the market were tortured. He recalled that Afghanistan had warned that it would close its consulate in Peshawar if the Afghan flag was removed from the market. ""We have now closed our consulate in Peshawar,"" he added. The Afghan consul general expressed reservations over the incident at the market and said the Qabza mafia must be stopped.

He said Pakistan must find a solution to the problem by using diplomatic channels. He said such acts should have been avoided at a time when the situation is uncertain and tense. A Pakistani citizen, Syed Intikhab Haider Abidi, had claimed ownership of the Afghan market in Peshawar.

The Supreme Court had decided the case in favour of another litigant, Zawar Hussain. Afghanistan's consulate in Peshawar claimed that the Afghan government owned the market as it had purchased it from the previous owner.

Complying with the orders of the Supreme Court and Peshawar High Court (PHC), the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Tuesday took steps to hand over the market to Zawar Hussain, who had won the case of ownership.

However, the shopkeepers at the market staged a protest against the move. The Afghan Consulate lodged a protest over the action. Meanwhile, Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan Shukrullah Atif Mashal visited the market and again hoisted the Afghan flag there.

Talking to the media, he claimed the market was owned by the National Bank of Afghanistan. He threatened that the Afghan Consulate in Peshawar would be closed if the flag was removed again. Subsequently, the police again removed theflag and in reaction the Afghan government closed its consulate in Peshawar.

When this correspondent visited the Afghan consulate at 5:00pm it was closed. A message was written on white paper that the Afghan Consulate had been closed. The police and district administration got the market vacated after PHC Chief Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth issued a notice to the officials to appear in person for framing of charges for non-compliance with the decisions of the Supreme Court and PHC to get the Afghan market vacated so that it could be handed over to the decree-holder.

The court had issued the notice in contempt of court petition filed by one Syed Intikhab Haider Abidi, a decree-holder of the Afghan National Market, situated in front of the Jinnah Park in Firdous locality in the city. It is spread over five kanals and 19 marlas of land.

Fazle Haq, the lawyer for the decree-holder, submitted before the court that despite the clear decisions of the Supreme Court and PHC in favour of the decree-holder, the district administration failed to implement the order to get the Afghan Market vacated from the National Bank of Afghanistan and other tenants, who are mostly Afghan traders.

It was pointed out in the contempt petition that the bank was collecting more than Rs1.5 million per month through its manager from the 180 shops and it was distributed among the respondent officials, including those from the local revenue and police departments as their due share.

The lawyer informed the bench that at the previous hearing, the PHC had directed the respondents, including the deputy commissioner and the capital city police officer Peshawar to get the market vacated and submit compliance report on September 12.

However, he stated that the respondent officials failed to comply with the court order. After losing the legal battle in the Supreme Court, an official of Afghan National Bank, Safiullah Kajori held a press conference to appeal to the Government of Pakistan and the PHC to review the decision about the ownership of the market in the city as the building had been purchased by the Afghan government in 1946.",negative
"PESHAWAR: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is bound to hold fresh local government election within 120 days after completion of the four-year term of the government but this time the commission is facing legal challenges as a fresh election under the new law has been challenged in the Peshawar High Court (PHC).

Under the Elections Act, 2017 the ECP is bound to hold the election in 120 days. Currently, several writ petitions have been filed in the PHC by political party Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), opposition parties in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, KP Local Government Association and individuals about the drastic changes made to the KP Local Government Act, 2013.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly had on May 29 this year passed the KP Local Government (Amendment) Act, 2019. It made changes to the 2013 law, especially reducing the three-tier local government system to two tiers by abolishing the district level tier.

Through some of the writ petitions, the KP Local Government (Amendment) Act, 2019, was challenged on multiple grounds. On the other hand, an official of the ECP told The News that the ECP would continue its preparations as per the law. The first writ petition was filed jointly by JI through Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Member Provincial Assembly Inayatullah Khan. The second petition was jointly filed by leader of the opposition in KP Assembly Akram Khan Durrani and parliamentary leaders of different opposition parties. The third petition was filed by the president of Local Council Association (LCA), Himayatullah Mayar, who has twice served as district nazim of Mardan.

A few individuals also filed petitions related to these amendments. One of the petitions, different from others, has been filed by MPA Mahmood Ahmad Khan Bhittani for holding local government elections in the province beyond the 120 days stipulated time.

The petitioners requested the court to declare that no election process can be initiated under the Elections Act, 2017 in the absence of requirements of KP Local Government (Amendment) Act, 2019, which provides for completing the required administrative actions within six months. However, one of the grievances of the petitioners is common, especially the abolition of the district tier of the local governments.

The petitioners believed that the purpose of the impugned amendments was to devolve some of the powers of the district council and district nazim to the tehsil government, while the rest would be returned to the provincial government.

They say that the amended act was aimed at returning the control of many devolved departments to the government. Initially, under the KP Local Government Act (KPLGA), 2013, 24 departments were devolved to the districts.

However, through different amendments, eight of the departments were returned to the province. Now, under the impugned amendments only nine departments are left with the local governments.

The petitioners contend that once the departments were devolved to the local councils, the same could not be returned to the province.

Article 140-A was incorporated in the Constitution through the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010. Article 140-A (1) states: “Each province shall, by law, establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local government.”

Similarly, sub-section 2 of Article 140-A provides that “Election to the local governments shall be held by the Election Commission of Pakistan.”

Ali Haider, who is counsel in Local Government Association petition, said the law provides for direct elections for electing members of the district and tehsil councils, unlike the previous ordinance under which nazims and naib nazims of a union council served as members of the district and tehsil councils, respectively. He explained that instead of union council, the third tier in the present law was that of village/neighborhood council having 10 to 15 members, including: five to 10 Muslim members, determined on the basis of population, elected to general seats; two members elected to seats reserved for women; one member each elected to seat reserved for peasants and workers, youth and non-Muslims.

Another lawyer Khushdil Khan pointed out that in the previous law elections of all tiers were non-party based whereas in KPLGA the district and tehsil polls were party-based whereas that of village council were not party-based.

Now under the present amendments, he stated that the village/neighbourhood councils would be having seven members, including three on general seats, one each on seats for women, youth, peasants or workers and non-Muslims.

The chairman of tehsil council will be elected through party-based polls held on the joint electorate and the whole tehsil serving as a single constituency for that purpose. Moreover, all chairmen of village/neighbourhood councils will also serve as members of their respective tehsil councils.

The PHC bench comprising Justice Ikramullah Khan and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah has, so far, dismissed one petition from a citizen of Haripur seeking the poll delay on various grounds.

However, the legal experts said that the high court should decide the cases on an urgent basis so that the ECP has the time to start preparing for the next LG polls without any legal complications.",negative
"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) and the district judiciary achieved targets by decreasing the backlog of cases in the province in the first Judicial Performance Year.

Sharing Judicial Performance Report (September 2018 to August 2019) with the media, PHC Registrar Khwaja Wajihuddin said that despite a shortage of judges, both the PHC and district judiciary performed well and decreased the pendency of cases up to some extent. Sharing the information of cases at the district level, he said that the total pendency has been reduced from 204,958 to 192, 066 cases in four quarters and backlog of 12892 cases were reduced at the district level.

He said the performance at district level was very encouraging at a time when former tribal areas were merged with KP and judicial cases were transferred to the regular judicial system. About the performance report of the PHC, he said that in the Judicial Performance Year 457,408 cases were instituted while a total of 458,546 cases were disposed of. However, he said currently 38,846 cases were pending at PHC’s principal bench and circuit benches.

Flanked by Member Inspection Team Muhammad Zubair and Legal Draftsman Sultan Ahmad Tareen, Khwaja Wajihuddin said that the provincial government failed to fill the 40 sanctioned posts of additional district and sessions judges. He added the PHC faced a shortage of 87 civil judges and the positions would be filled through the Public Service Commission.

Khwaja Wajihuddin said the PHC had sent a summary for the establishment of anti-terrorism courts to deal with terrorism-related cases but the provincial government returned it twice. He said the PHC had also sent summary for the establishment of 34 Child Protection Courts in the province, but the government refused it. However, he said after the success of first-ever provincial Child Protection Court, the PHC is going to inaugurate two more child protection courts today at Abbottabad and Mardan districts. About the performance of merged districts, he said until now the district judiciary in erstwhile Fata the regular courts had decided 2078 cases while 8084 including old FCR cases were pending before the courts. However, 5506 new cases were instituted in the regular courts in erstwhile Fata. About achievement of targets, he said consultations in term of workshops, meetings, and online video conferences were held with district judiciary. He said notifications were also issued to district courts in term of 6 percent or above disposals over the institutions and requested the provincial government for the creation of seats.

It said trainings were imparted to members of the bar and bench on case management rules. He said Data Analysis Wing had been created to assist in decision and policy-making.",negative

‘Increasing child rape cases, underage marriages show failure of criminal, social justice systems’
Increasing incidents of child rape and underage marriages are a glaring evidence of the failure of our criminal justice and social justice systems, said noted human rights lawyer and Madadgar Helpline founder Zia Awan while addressing a news conference at his office on Saturday.


Awan said that implementation of laws and protection of children did not seem to figure highly in the government’s priority of things. He said that had there been a viable implementation mechanism, these incidents would have been virtually non-existent.

“We have not even been able to set up a DNA laboratory, upscale the number of MLOs so that evidence of such crimes could be properly analysed, nor is there any change in the systems or response of the police that would help protect girl children from such monstrous acts.”

Besides, he said, the medico-legal systems should be totally computerised. He spoke in particular of the cases of two girls who had fallen victim to such wolves: nine-year-old Khadija Batool and 16-year-old Jessica; the former was found murdered and the latter disappeared with no trace while the police refuse to cooperate.

The next-of-kin of the two victims were also present to give a first-hand account of their tragedies. To recap, Khadija Batool — daughter of Manzoor Hussain Khokhar, an upper division clerk in the Pakistan Railways — lived at the Railway Colony marshalling yard, Bin Qasim.

A third grader in a TCF school, she commuted by rickshaw with her brothers and sisters. On February 28, she asked her father for some money to buy goodies. He complied and then took his other children to the market. On returning home after around an hour, he found that Khadija had not returned.

The family got down to searching her and asked the nearest mosque to announce her disappearance. Around 10pm, the neighbours and residents of the block started looking for her and went to flat No. 11, which was locked from the outside.

Further search revealed her body floating in the water tank, hands and feet tied and a piece of cloth shoved up her mouth to hush her screams. Her body was covered with bruises and her face with bite marks. Khokhar fainted at the sight.

Police arrived at the scene and sent the body to the JPMC. Detailed investigation and DNA tests showed that three men had subjected her to their bestiality. Khokhar’s neighbour Farhan Panhwar, son of Abdus Sattar Panhwar, and Ayaz Jokhio, son of Riaz Ali Jokhio, were arrested. The third culprit was neither identified nor arrested.

Khokhar said Panhwar was manipulating his release and would be free pretty soon, as he was a moneyed influential. He further revealed that the case had been going on in the ATC for three months, but the challan had not been submitted. This raises doubts about the sincerity of the police and makes the case process dubious.

The other case was that of a Christian girl, 16-year-old Jessica. He mother Parween is an ayah at a school and her father Tariq Masih is a street hawker in Saddar.

One day last month, Masih asked his younger daughter to wake Jessica up for school, but it turned out that Jessica was not there. Masih asked his wife if she had seen Jessica leave for school. She replied in the negative.

When she asked her other children, they said that her sister-in-law Marium used to force Jessica to talk to a male on the telephone, something that Marium denied when asked.

Marium took Parween and her two brothers, a sister’s husband, and a neighbour to the Cantonment police station. All along, Marium was trying to reach someone on the telephone, but her calls were not being received.

This convinced Parween that Marium was behind it all. Later, Marium told Parween that a man by the name of Maqsood had taken her daughter somewhere and that Marium’s brother Sammy was in the know of the whole matter.

Parween went through a real ordeal getting the FIR registered. Police, she said, milked her good and proper and when she was asked to accompany them to Marium’s house, she was asked to pay for the fuel for the police van.

From a relative, Parween received photographs of Jessica and who told her that Jessica was in Nankana in Punjab. Police asked Parween to go to Nankana and search for Jessica herself and bring her to Karachi, where they would start off the legal proceedings.

Parween does not have the means to travel all the way to Nankana and fetch Jessica, nor is she obliged to. That is the sole duty of the police. Parween broke down during the narration of her ordeal and found it difficult to speak amid her sobs and hiccups.

Awan said that this was the state of justice in our country. He said that ironically enough, the government was coming up with new institutions to curb such vicious evils, but things were getting worse, as there was no mechanism to see to the implementation of the laws.

The system of investigation, he said, was outdated and there was no seriousness on the part of the investigating authorities. He told the media that the Madadgar Helpline had gone to the authorities with the petition for correcting the medico-legal system, the forensic system, and the way things were conducted at the mortuaries.

He said they had also demanded that the eight major hospitals in the city remain open round the clock all seven days of the week, so that there would be no delay in conducting the medico-legal formalities, as that could affect the course of the proceedings.

Awan said that this was the state of the judicial response in our set-up; the poor man had no recourse to justice; it was highly pitiable to see both the affected families imploring the prime minister, the chief justice and the chief of army staff to intervene in the matter to bring Khadija’s killers to book and see to the safe return of Jessica.",negative
"Because of population and wealth, Punjab is the dominant element in the Pakistani state. Whoever commands Punjab rules Pakistan.         Punjab is not without its high achievements. Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, and Waris Shah – to name only these three from a long list – were all from Punjab. Whether their immortal poetry has left any mark on the Punjabi mind is of course another matter. 

The galaxy of verse does not end there. Among the moderns are such imperishable names as Iqbal, Faiz, Munir Niazi, Sahir Ludhianvi, and others too numerous to be named. In the world of immortal song and music we have Kundan Lal Saigal, Muhammad Rafi, Noor Jahan, Suraiya, Shamshad Begum, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Madan Mohan, etc.             

Saigal and Rafi in their field, and Iqbal and Faiz in theirs, were pioneers who set out new paths for others to follow. Punjab, however, has produced few path-breakers in the political field except perhaps for the unforgettable Sardar Bhagat Singh, the great freedom fighter whose statue if we had any sense of history would stand in Shadman Chowk near where he was hanged by the British.

To sum up, the problem lies not with Punjab’s poetic or artistic legacy. Punjab’s place in that constellation is assured. The problem lies with its history. For all the abundance of genius in other fields, Punjab gave birth to no great kings or captains of armies, with the one, solitary exception of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Sukerchakia of Gujranwala, later of course founder of the first and last Sikh kingdom. The rest is a blank.

Geography decreed that every invader with his mind fixed on the conquest of Delhi should first stop in Lahore. Marauding armies came and marched through Punjab on their way to Delhi and the rich plains beyond, meeting little resistance in the land of the five rivers or its capital, Lahore…this city of a thousand tales, steeped in romance and the promise of hidden pleasures, like an obliging mistress repelling no one and opening its arms to everyone who stood before its walls.

Multan, considered by most thorough-bred Punjabis to be a soft and decadent city, put up some resistance to Alexander. On its walls the world-conqueror was wounded which so enraged the Macedonians that they carried out a general massacre in the town. Multan resisted the British too and it was only after a tight battle that the city fell to them.      

Lahore’s fame in history rests on other things: the extent and splendour of its gardens, the waters of the Ravi which gave a balmy air to the city, and the storied charms of its dancing girls. It is among the achievements of the Islamic Republic that the gardens of the city have shrunk, the waters of the Ravi are now irredeemably dirty – making it impossible for any latter-day Master Madan (not to be confused with Madan Mohan) to sing “Ravi de parle kande ve mitra, wasda ai dil da chor” (check it out on YouTube) – and in the legendary singing and entertainment quarter of the city are now mostly to be found dreary little shops selling khussas and other forms of footwear.

No great city with any sense of its past destroys its entertainment districts the way our great and good ones have managed to do with the streets around the Badshahi Mosque where lay, for centuries, the singing and dancing quarter visited by high and low alike.

No Siege of Leningrad ever took place around Lahore and for that matter none around the fabled capital of Hindustan, Delhi. The two cities had this in common: greeting with fawning courtesy any invader who came along to ravish them.

In this long saga of ready surrender and capitulation Ranjit Singh is the only figure we find who was adept at the use of arms. He brought the various Sikh misls (call them factions) together, forging a strong kingdom out of them. Unlettered as he was, he had the sense not to clash with the East India Company, quick to realise that its fighting strength was greater than his own. But the British also had the good sense not to cast covetous eyes on his kingdom as long as he lived. They too had the measure of their adversary.

But even as the Maharaja kept his peace with the British he expanded his kingdom into Kashmir where Gulab Singh, appointed the ruler by him, paid him annual tribute, and westwards where by defeating the Afghans near Nowshera he went on to capture Peshawar. When the British annexed Punjab after the Maharaja’s death, they inherited his kingdom and its extended frontiers…meaning thereby that but for Ranjit Singh, Peshawar, the tribal areas and the Durand Line would not form part of our inheritance. At the bar of history we owe the Sikh warrior-king this debt of gratitude.

The lines of Partition were so drawn that while East Bengal lay a thousand miles away, in what was West Pakistan the dominant element was Punjab. East Pakistan had a slight edge in terms of population but power was in the hands of the Punjabi and Urdu-speaking-dominated bureaucracy and military, with the Punjabi feudal class playing loyal second fiddle to a coalition which came to shape the ideology and thinking of the new state. The intellectual inspiration for this coalition came principally from Urdu-speaking migrants from India, inheritors of the culture of Delhi, Lucknow, Bhopal and Hyderabad Deccan.

Pakistan quickly aligning itself with the West and becoming front-ranking member of American-led military alliances, the injection of heavy doses of religion into the national discourse, and the patronising behaviour, little short of a colonial attitude, towards East Pakistan all flowed from the biases and ideological orientation of this ruling coalition.

The Punjabi element already strong in the ruling echelons of the state became still more dominant and powerful after the separation of East Pakistan. The Zia regime had a compelling interest in developing a counterpoint to the Pakistan People’s Party with which it was virtually at war after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s ouster and hanging. Looking around for likely partisans it picked and groomed a cast of characters whose apotheosis we can witness in the form of the ruling PML-N leadership.

It truly represents Punjab in that it exemplifies more perfectly than anything else can the limited political imagination and equally limited historical sense of this most powerful of Pakistan’s constituent provinces.

In various forms and incarnations this leadership has been in power for the last 30 years. It can remain in power for the next 30 years and its leading lights will still be playing the only repertoire with which they are familiar: tape-cutting, over-the-top rhetoric often with little relation to reality, and putting more and more, through whatever means available, into their already burgeoning treasure chests.

With such helmsmen Pakistan can never become a modern republic, where science, technology and rational thinking hold sway and where the state takes as its first duty the education and uplift of its citizens. This is what makes the Panama case so important. More than an ordinary case, it is an opportunity to turn around the country’s fortunes by breaking the stranglehold of Punjabi mediocrity and the limitations that come from it.",negative
"Pakistan has tested a missile with a range of 2200 kilometres and capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads, and the usual patriots – no shortage of this clan here, which elsewhere would be called hawks – are agog with excitement.

We are a nuclear power and have been for some time. Yet the strange thing is that instead of steadying the national ship and giving us some confidence, our super-hawks despite this capability get rattled every time there is a sneeze or cough from India. An Indian defence minister, army chief or super-hawk – there being plenty of this kind over there too – has only to let out some inanity about a cold-start doctrine or teaching Pakistan a lesson, and retired generals and self-appointed analysts here can be counted upon to mount the ramparts, beat their drum and raise the alarm.

What is with us? Israel has a nuclear arsenal but it keeps its mouth shut about it. The world knows it has nuclear weapons and for Israel that is enough. But we must keep talking about our nuclear prowess, in season and out. Israel never says its defence is invulnerable. It lets the facts speak for themselves. Hezbollah, Israel’s only credible rival in the Middle East, also never boasts about its toughness and resilience, qualities it has in ample measure. For it too actions speak louder than words.

This logic applies not to us. We must keep talking about our military and nuclear strength, and we must do so endlessly, perhaps not so much to frighten our enemies as to reassure ourselves. A nation more sure of itself would not lay so much store by verbal protestations.

But Ababeel, the multiple-warhead missile, is about testing not boasting. And the question this latest test raises is: how much of a nuclear deterrent does Pakistan require? In a rational world one nuclear bomb, with the attendant deliver capacity, would be enough. The other side can have a hundred bombs to match that one bomb, but that one bomb capable of wiping out Delhi or Mumbai (since we are talking of India) will be a sufficient deterrent.

We, however, have a veritable arsenal – bombs, missile delivery systems, cruise missile capability, and now even tactical nuclear weapons ostensibly for battlefield use. Anyone would say we were spoiled for choice. Yet instead of being satisfied with this varied capability Pakistan continues to dip into its scarce resources to engage in a never-ending arms race with India.

India doesn’t have to attack us. It need only keep us engaged in this folly and its ends – of keeping Pakistan tied down in an endless quest for security – will be achieved.

But the military are their own strategic masters, formulating their deterrence doctrines without a nod or suggestion from any other quarter. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto started Pakistan down the nuclear track. That credit cannot be taken away from him. But since his time nuclear doctrine has been the close preserve of the army command. What the army command decides, the nation, willy-nilly, follows. For nuclear doctrine – the narrative of deterrence – has been turned into a holy cow. No one dare question it for that amounts to a breach of patriotism.

Civilians in any event are careful to keep their hands off this subject – first, because they lack the expertise, not tutored in the hocus-pocus of deterrence; and, second, because the civilian leadership for the last 30 years if not more, from all sides of the political spectrum, has been more interested in such concrete endeavours as lining its pockets than worrying itself over such abstractions as nuclear doctrine.

There couldn’t be a neater division of labour: the military into defence, security, missiles and, let us not forget, defence housing authorities; and the civilians into dubious deals with fat commissions thrown in, overseas properties and offshore accounts – the military atop the commanding heights of national security and the civilians holding aloft the banner of democracy and ‘democratic continuity’.

This is a blanket amnesty scheme: all follies forgiven in the name of national security and all sins condonable at the altar of democracy.

Pakistan cannot invade and conquer Kashmir, whatever the Reverend Hafiz Saeed’s opinion on this subject. To hear him is to get a lesson in strategy Clausewitz would have found hard to configure. But Pakistan has enough strength to deter any Indian adventurism. So what is it afraid of?

Our generals should be teaching the nation assurance and self-confidence. Instead, serving or retired – and the retired ones are the worst – they continually feed a sense of chronic insecurity, aided by an entire army of retired foreign office hawks. As we know, there are no hawks like armchair hawks.

Pakistan has problems but they lie not in the realm of security or an imaginary nuclear imbalance. Pakistan is not educating its people and it is not creating enough wealth for national uplift and regeneration. Our economy is not ticking the way it should and our country is ridden with debt that soon would be unsustainable.

These are our problems, compounded by the fact that we have a ruling class that would scarcely find its match anywhere for unabashed corruption and incompetence. Are multiple-headed nuclear missiles the answer to these problems?

We once sold our so-called geostrategic importance as if the world revolved around the pivot of our geography. We are now pinning our hopes for the future on the Chinese corridor – anything for a free ride.

In the cold war there was no missile gap between the United States and the Soviet Union. This was a bogey raised at the time by American hawks and the military-industrial complex and it was so successful that the US entered a mad arms race, creating super-weapons of no earthly use for any kind of strategic balance. There is now an extensive literature on this subject and we in India and Pakistan could do worse than spend some time studying it.

There is no missile gap between India and Pakistan and those who say there is are fooling the Pakistani nation – that, let it be said, for all its vaunted cleverness, is easily fooled. Otherwise it wouldn’t easily suffer the chumps it has for its leaders, or easily put up with the doctrines that pass for nuclear necessity and wisdom.",negative
"Pakistan’s motorisation rate – which is the number of passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants – stood at 17 in 2015. This is an estimate provided by the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA). Assuming that the rate has remained the same over the last two years, this would mean that there are approximately 3,532,600 cars on the roads of this country.


With over 36 percent of the population living in urban centres, it is safe to assume that the bulk of these cars are also operating on the roads of the country’s main cities – Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar.

For its part, Lahore has seen a spate of urban development projects, flyovers, metro lines and signal-free corridors. And while the jury is hung on the positive impact of these projects on the flow of traffic in the city, there is a pressing concern that remains unattended: parking and the utter lack thereof.

Go anywhere you like and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a suitable space to park your car. If indeed a dedicated parking area is available, it may already be overflowing with vehicles. The lack of parking spaces has resulted in the rise of private parking lots in empty plots across the city. But the demand clearly outnumbers the supply.

Providing parking is a triple-edged sword. The first challenge is to determine exactly how much space is required. The second is that limited space will impede growth. The third challenge is that too much space will reduce the land available for other economic purposes.

Any form of development in the city is governed by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), which has laid down clear regulations for parking within its building regulations. There is a minimum parking provision for all forms of construction – from farmhouses and apartment buildings to hotels, industrial buildings, warehouses and godowns. However, if we are to believe the engineers and architects, none of these regulations are followed. It is obvious that before any construction physically takes place, a plan has to be approved by the relevant authority – in this case, the LDA. We must ask how plans that are in clear violation of the LDA’s regulations are approved. On the other hand, let’s say that the plans presented to the LDA are correct. What measures are taken by the LDA to ensure that the actual construction is based on that plan and not something else? Apparently, they take action – but only against those they can.

The other direct outcome of the lack of parking spaces is encroachment. On nearly every street in the city, cars of all shapes and sizes are parked on the sides of the road and often take up an entire lane. There are vendors selling their wares and rickshaws, waiting for their next ride. Occasionally, we see traffic wardens with their lifters, picking up one car from a line of 100 encroachers. But more often than not, encroachments are par for the course. Some say this does not reflect the concerned department’s inefficiency, but just shows how the authorities deliberately turn a blind eye to the matter in lieu of cold hard cash.

Such encroachments take on unprecedented levels when it comes to schools and colleges. Again, the regulation laid down is very clear: “a separate lane for pick and drop purposes shall be provided within the plot outside the boundary wall by providing a 15 foot wide space within the set back area”.

But for the large number of schools that have cropped up on main roads and deep inside residential areas, this is not possible. What happens then is what happens every day: a fine mess. It’s also questionable why and how multiple schools have been allowed to open up next to each other – a surefire way of at least doubling the number of cars on the road twice a day.

So far, there is little action taken by the government on this matter. Instead, what they have done is to try and provide alternative means of commuting – be it the metro line or the red buses that dot Lahore’s urban landscape. And while both these two options are in use, what the government may have failed to consider is that if a person has a car, he or she will be inclined to use it. Owning a car is a status symbol.

Not everyone lives close to metro stations or bus stops. And for a large portion of the year, high temperatures ensure that the walk to the nearest pick-up point is, at the very least, uncomfortable if not downright treacherous. So those who can get into their own cars and make their merry way. Even options like Uber and Careem have failed to make a mentionable dent in the number of cars on the road.

As the number of cars on Lahore’s roads increases by the day and the city’s remaining aesthetics are eaten up by one new building after another, it would be prudent for those in charge to look at the institutional corruption that is responsible for the lack of sufficient parking spaces within the city.",negative
"April 24, 2015: Karachi. Renowned activist Sabeen Mahmud had just been murdered. As her friends, family and well-wishers tried to comprehend what had happened, some took to social media to vent their grief and anger. One such person was Aliya (name changed to protect identity), who posted a strong rebuke to the country for her friend’s death. Little did she know then that she was about to come under a coordinated online attack which would eventually force her to suspend her social media accounts for a while.


As Aliya and her friends were preparing for a protest against Sabeen’s death in Islamabad, her tweet on the night of Sabeen’s murder resurfaced. It had been tagged by an account with 10,000 users with a remarkably high engagement ratio. The conversation between this account and its followers revolved around targeting Aliya. Soon, other right-wing accounts also got involved. The conversation revolved around either directly threatening the lady in question with rape or murder, or trying to incite others to commit violence against her.

By this time, Aliya’s friends had also gotten involved, suggesting that she delete her tweet which had brewed such a storm. But by then, it was too late. Her comment had been copied, and the coordinated attack against her had moved to Facebook. One page, with over 350,000 likes was leading the charge, continuing to threaten and abuse the person in question. There were over a thousand comments in the said conversation.

With the attacks continuing to gather speed, Aliya’s friends suggested she go offline for a while. She deactivated her Twitter account, which lead to celebratory tweets from the accounts that had attacked her.

The nightmare wasn’t over yet. Even a year later, when she resumed her social media activity, she continued to get the occasional abuse and threat, either on Twitter or on Facebook.

Aliya is not alone. There are numerous other individuals and groups that have been targeted online, either for their religious beliefs (or lack thereof), their sexual orientation or their politics.

Who is behind all these coordinated attacks? Is it just a group of likeminded people or is something more sinister happening?

The answer is not immediately clear. Take, for example, political parties. All of them have well-funded social media wings, which operate on all popular platforms. Their agenda is multi-pronged. Not only do they spread the party’s mantra, they are always on the lookout to engage with the public in the hope of bringing them into their fold. Also, these groups do not miss any opportunity to bring their opponents down. At the same time, they monitor the local media looking for news they can highlight to their benefit, or play down/defend for their party.

The same is the case with religio-political groups such as the Jamaatud Dawa. Their aim, online at least, is to highlight the charity work being done by them, while highlighting the atrocities being done by the Indians in Kashmir. This makes sense, as the Kashmir cause is one of the main rallying cries for the group and remains one of their main sources of funding and recruitment.

From here things become murkier. There are numerous accounts, pages and groups, on Twitter and Facebook, which bring together a motley crew of people, both in Pakistan and abroad. The only thing bringing these people together is some kind of shared identity. It can be neo-nationalism, anti-liberalism, anti-secularism etc. In Aliya’s case, she was attacked by not one but at least two such groups. What Aliya said online ran counter to what these two groups stood for.

However, the most dangerous subject matter is religion, and by extension, ethics and morality. Pakistan’s current state of Islamisation is such that people are willing to take a person’s life on mere suspicion.

Where does the law stand on this? Freedom of expression and speech, both offline and online, is a fundamental human right. Pakistan is a signatory of numerous international accords which protect an individual’s rights to FoE and FoS both. The on-ground situation is clearly quite different, though.

Recently, the government has launched a crackdown on what it calls the ‘misuse of social media’. According to them, this misuse includes blasphemous content, and disrespecting the armed forces. While blasphemy is criminalised, there is no law whatsoever that protects any government institution or person from criticism. Yet, the government is busy silencing online dissent.

Why is this happening? Many people believe that a new national narrative is being forged. Social media was the last frontier for those that found it difficult to conform to the norm. Such people also include those who were mere free thinkers, asking questions of themselves and their beliefs. These conversations are dying down.

In this new Pakistan, there will be no room for any form of intellectual conversation, thought or critique. How a society can move forward in such an Orwellian environment is anybody’s guess.",negative
"There’s nothing quite like a fully functional and vibrant democracy. After all, which other political system will allow the president of your closest ally to speak before your elected representatives to soundly criticise your own president?
But that’s how US-Israeli ties go. However, Benyamin Netanyahu may have finally overstretched himself – a rare feat for a man who is a strong, nationalist leader.
The fact that Bibi’s speech had a few historical mistakes is no matter. Nor is the fact that’s he’s been at this stage before, and pretty much said the same things. Iran’s this close to the bomb. If we don’t stop them now, the security of Israel, the Middle East, the United States and every living organism on the face of this earth is at risk. It’s the same old song.
Does Israel really think that the morning after Iran gets the bomb, they’re going to launch a Kamikaze attack on Tel Aviv, Netanya and Haifa? Or maybe they won’t even wait that long, and the first complete nuclear weapon will be taken straight from the lab onto a missile with Shalom Israel written on its side?
Has Bibi mistakenly overlooked the historical precedent of nuclear weapons being one of the best deterrents to violence? Apart from the Cuban missile crisis back in 1962, and perhaps one other exception, the world has been safer because of opposing countries having nukes.
Probably not.
What’s the matter then?
First, a little backdrop. Ties between Washington and Tehran haven’t been this warm in over 30 years. The two are cooperating against Isis in Iraq, and negotiating a settlement on the nuclear issue. And while progress on the latter topic is slow, one thing is now certain thanks to Bibi’s haste in addressing the US Congress: the nuclear deal is on.
Iran’s crescent has steadily been rising in the Middle East. It has always been a leading player in Syria and Lebanon, and is at the forefront of the war against Isis in Iraq. And there’s

Hezbollah as well. More on them later.
This Iranian rise in influence is occurring in a region which has predominantly been a stronghold of US influence, with key allies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates etc. These countries view Iran as revolutionary and expansionist. It’s ability to cause further mischief will be significantly enhanced with nukes in its arsenal.
And US Secretary of State John Kerry’s immediate visit to his gulf allies after his three-day meetings with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Javad Zarif, was solely meant to appraise and reassure the Sunni states that the US won’t allow a fundamental shift in the balance of power in the region.
Because if Iran manages to go nuclear, and by nuclear one means not nuclear energy but nuclear arms, it will not only shake the foundations of this precarious geopolitical balance, but perhaps more dangerously add further fuel to the ongoing intra-Islam war. Will the House of Saud or Sisi in Egypt sit back and be content with Iran having nuclear weapons in their backyard?
Probably not.
If they can’t stop it, then at the very least they’ll go scurrying around looking for some themselves. That’s called an arms race, and it will be a right old nightmare for Israel: Not one, not two, but perhaps a handful of Arab states, rushing hither and thither in search of nukes.
Imagine. Poor old Israel. Surrounded in the near future by nuke-totting, Jew-hating Arabs. And God forbid, if chance throws up a leader like Anwar Sadat, or Hafez al-Assad, anything could happen.
But then again, the chances of anything like that happening are close to zero.
And then there’s Hezbollah. Does Israel fear that if Iran goes nuclear, one or two weapons won’t find their way into the wily hands of Hasan Nasrallah and co? The ties that bind Iran and Hezbollah are strong and deep. The most recent example of their flourishing relationship is when an Israeli strike in the Syrian part of the Golan Heights killed not only Jihad Mughniyeh, the son of a Hezbollah military chief but also Iranian General Allah Dadi, along with at least six other Iranian soldiers.
Now, it is common knowledge that the Iranians are actively involved in the fight to defend Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but to find such a senior member of their armed forces so close to the Israeli border surely would have rung some loud bells in Tel Aviv.
There will need to be some serious checks in place to ensure that there is no pilferage.
Retrospectively, the world has found that Stalin in Russia, Mao in China and Kim in North Korea all pursued, and eventually acquired, nuclear weapons for two clear reasons: a) to counter opponents that already had them and, perhaps more importantly, to ensure regime continuity. But these revelations came long after they had acquired these weapons. Should Iran be given the chance?
Absolutely.
Why does all this matter here in Pakistan? Well. Quite simply, the Middle East is changing. Pakistan is allied with the House of Saud, and all those that come with it. And while the ties that bind us to Riyadh are mostly religious, there are thousands of miles between us and them. Iran, on the other, is right here. There are numerous advantages to be had from an allied neighbour. Apart from China, Pakistan doesn’t have any other friends in the region. We will do well to take our relationship with Tehran further.",negative
"It happens every time. There is a terror incident somewhere in the country, and shortly afterwards we find out that there was intelligence available of an imminent attack. And one can only wonder why, if there was intelligence available, the security agencies were unable to nip it in the bud.
There are various reasons for this. First and foremost is the fact that most of these reports are rather vague. Four suicide bombers have entered the city. A car filled with explosives is roaming around on the streets. If this is what the intelligence reports suggest, they aren’t specific enough for the law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) to take action on. And since these reports are usually about urban areas, the attackers could be anywhere – it’s like searching for a needle in a haystack.
And secondly, as someone who has been in this line of work for two decades told me, some of these reports aren’t authentic and are more of a retrospective cover-up rather than anything concrete.
But let’s go with the former. The intelligence agencies float a warning. Something is up in the city. What happens next?
At the grassroots level, the local police station is your one-stop shop for everything that is happening in the area. The SHO of the police station is the person who generally knows of all the happenings in his jurisdiction: the petty criminals, the drug peddlers, the gangs, the car-jackers, the pimps and the working girls, he’s usually in the know. He usually even knows what the good imam is up to at the mosque.
So, perhaps the question to ask is this: do these intelligence reports go all the way down to the local police stations or not?
Back in the day every police station used to have a detective foot constable – a person whose only job was to collect chatter. He would build relationships with all the good people mentioned above, and find out what was going down in his area. And at the end of his shift he would present the SHO with a report.


Slowly, as with everything else in this country, this grassroots intelligence gathering mechanism died away.
Now, if all the local police stations were actively picking up chatter from their areas, and there was a top-down mechanism of intelligence sharing, they could possibly connect the dots to the bigger picture. But being a good cop does not necessarily equal being a good analyst.
Intelligence analysis is a very specialised field. Much like bomb defusal. Proper analysts, with the right kind of background and experience need to be brought in to join the counterterrorism departments in the province, and upwardly connected to Nacta.
Second, there needs to be an online intelligence repository to back up the analysts. Pakistan used to have the Pakistan Automated Fingerprint System (PAFIS), which was an updateable, searchable, centralised mechanism for collecting, categorising and cross analysing fingerprints of all criminals. Three years ago, this tool ran out of system. Why? Because nobody in the government was willing to pick up the internet bill. So, to go with the detective foot constable and the intelligence analysts, this major source of intelligence needs to be brought back online, and all the entries missed in the last three years be updated.
Here’s an eye-opening statistic. More than 50 percent of cases in Punjab in the last two years have been dismissed by the courts because of faulty investigation. The fault being that the name of the accused was not mentioned in the First Information Report (FIR). The question to ask is: how can you write the name of the accused when you don’t know who he or she is?
Usually, investigation teams visit the site of an incident and pick up clues such as cell phones, SIMs, explosive materials, body parts, CCTV footage and then, using all this circumstantial evidence, piece together a theory of what happened and who may be responsible.
Can any of this evidence be used in a court of law?
The evidence act needs a comprehensive overhaul. We don’t live in the 16th century anymore.
Last but not the least is securing the magistrate and the witness alike. A very large number of cases are dismissed because nobody is willing to be a witness, fearing reprisal. And the magistrate will most likely find a loophole to dismiss the case for the same reasons. The world has moved on to faceless witnesses and judges to overcome this very real hurdle. It’s high time we did too.
And just another word on the SHO again. In many cases, he is personally able to convince the witness to testify because of his relationships in his area. In many other cases, he is able to produce a witness.
Pakistan’s challenges in securing the state are of epic proportions, demanding institutional overhaul in nearly every little sector. Obviously, all this takes time. And will. We have neither. At the very least, we can re-deploy tools already existing within the system.
Otherwise, we’ll keep having attacks after attacks, later hearing of prior intelligence reports predicting them.",negative
"Let’s talk cricket for a while. One match in particular. Yes, that one. On one side there was India. Reigning world champions with arguably the strongest batting line-up the cricketing world has ever seen, solid fielders and a mediocre bowling attack.
On the other side there was us, with both our bowling and batting at perhaps their weakest in a decade. And lurking overhead was history. Pakistan’s World Cup record against India is perhaps as tragic as South Africa’s repeated choking in crunch matches.
Yet, we expected a win. With all the chips stacked against us, we expected our bowlers to make regular inroads into the opposition’s batting line up, that our fielders would take catches out of nowhere, construct run-outs, and stop certain boundaries. We expected our bowlers to bowl in the corridor of uncertainty, ask questions of the Indian batsmen, eventually forcing the inevitable batting collapse.
It never happened, and soon the chase was on.
Again, contrary to all the statistics and historical records available, we expected our batting line up to make easy work of a demanding total. Sneaky singles, twos converted into threes and the obligatory boundary per over was all we asked for. It was all we expected.
It never happened.
Thank God it’s just a game, eh?
But if you look closely, there’s a much greater disease at play. It’s called our national delusion, and unfortunately, there’s no real cure for the condition.
Let’s leave cricket for now. There are other matches to lose in the coming days anyway.
Remember Peshawar? It was over two months ago when supposedly everything changed. They called it a game changer, a watershed moment. The gallows started to swing and so did the promised reprisals. Since then, we’ve had Shikarpur, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Lahore.
The much publicised National Action Programme (NAP) is hiding somewhere in the corner. As a concept, the document is comprehensive. It covers, by and large,


most of the action the state must take in order to stem the advancing threat of terrorism and extremism.
Yet, it defies history.
Over the last few weeks, I have tried to utilise the space provided to me in this newspaper to highlight how history is not on our side when it comes to the implementation of the NAP. From regulating and registering madressahs, to choking financing for terrorists and terrorist organisations, from ensuring the re-emergence of banned organisations to zero tolerance for militancy in Punjab, all this has come under the pen, so to speak. And I’d rather not repeat myself.
The fact is that these are all non-starters.
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are major shortcomings within our current system that will not allow any sort of tangible progress to take place even if there is political will, which is not the case.
What is actually required is multi-institutional overhaul, but to deflect our easily distracted minds the government has resorted to low impact, high visibility projects like the counterterrorism force (CTF). We must not fall for this ploy. As Abraham Lincoln once said, “You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time.”
Somebody needs to call their bluff. And no better one to do it than us: civil society. We must press for action on the NAP and demand regular updates on all that has been achieved since the NAP came into existence.
Mobilising civil society comes with its own challenges, first and foremost being the formation and acceptance of a unified civil front. Without that, what you get is what we have right now – isolated groups of people putting together vigils and protests, not being able to gather the right amount of mouths needed for a collective voice to be heard. There is strength in numbers.
The key is to simplify the matter. If one gets into the nitty-gritty of why the government is failing against terrorism etc, that opens up a Pandora’s box of conflicting views and positions which takes us away from what we want done.
So, precisely what is it that we want to do? Do we want to end terrorism? Defeat extremism? Sure. But what needs to happen for ‘that’ to happen? Well, somebody needs to pull their socks up, don’t they? Therefore, ending terrorism and extremism is ‘the end’, and the means to that end, can possibly be, asking hard questions.
Change takes time. Permanent institutional change takes even longer. It will be naive of us to think that we, in our lifetime, will be able to bring about any substantial and concrete change. However, there are other generations on the way. And I, for one, shudder at the Pakistan they will have to deal with.
We can’t save Pakistan for ourselves, but we can try for them. Start small. Civil society must understand that by asking for too much they gain nothing. Right now, all we can do is ask questions. Uncomfortable questions. And demand answers. And like Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption keep asking and writing. Day in and day out. Maybe one day we’ll get a response.",negative
"The west has long pointed an accusing finger at Pakistan’s policy of dealing with terrorists, alleging that: a) the state differentiates between those that directly attack the country, it’s citizens, soldiers and institutions – the bad Taliban – and those that operate across the eastern border in Afghanistan, and westwards in Occupied Kashmir and beyond – the good Taliban; and b) that the Deep State actively supports the former. This accusation has come to be known as Pakistan’s good and bad Taliban policy.
However, not too long ago, there were no good and bad Taliban. In fact, there were no Taliban – there were mujahideen. And go a little further back, there were no mujahids either, only lashkars: groups of civilians banding (or banded) together for a common, overt or covert, cause. Over the course of history, numerous countries across the globe, Pakistan included, have nurtured and used civilians to either supplement certain requirements of the state or act in a certain manner on the state’s behest.
These are known as non-state actors.
It all started back in 1947/48, with the fate of the princely state of Kashmir hanging in a fine balance. A motley crew of tribal fighters from across Fata and the then North West Frontier Province (NWFP), coupled with state irregulars, moved towards the state on the pretext of suppressing a rebellion but soon turned their focus towards Srinagar. That’s when Hari Singh solicited the help of our neighbours, who agreed to help, with the caveat of Singh signing off on the accession to India.
The rallying cry for the 1947 Kashmir incursion had been a potent mix of patriotism and religion: nationalistic Islam, shall we say.
The next time this came around was in 1970/71, when General Yahya Khan, with the Jamaat-e-Islami, formed, trained, armed and unleashed on the hapless Bengalis, two organisations: Al-Badr and Al-Shams. These two are the first instance of an organised non-state organisation being

used by the state.
In this particular episode, nationalism took a secondary role to religion. The groups had been used to smash seculars and anti-nationalists. To put it plainly, Pakistani nationalism died in Bangladesh in 1971 and was replaced by religion.
Then Afghanistan happened.
Much and more has been written about Pakistan’s role in the Afghan resistance, which was what it was, until General Zia decided to use religion to turn it into jihad. From 1979 onwards, Pakistan became the landing ground and launching pad for any Muslim who wanted to fight in Afghanistan. And since religion was now the rallying cry against the invading infidel, madressahs mushroomed across the length and breadth of the country. Midway through the resistance, the quintessential jihadist outfit was formed, known as the Harkatul Jihad al Islami. (HuJI). Retrospectively, the HuJI came to be the parent group for other outfits such as the Harkatul Mujahideen (HuM), the Harkatul Ansar (HuA) and the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).
But not of all these groups were focused on the Russians. Zia, being who he was, (a perfect opportunist) saw the physical space created by the Afghan mujahids, and the success of the jihad injection into Afghanistan, to nurture the next crop of non-state actors, for use on the eastern front. Groups such as those named above, after the Soviet retreat, recalibrated their focus towards Kashmir. It is widely believed that three groups: the HuJi, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the JeM emerged from the same source.
By this time, hundreds of jihadi outfits had emerged. Some were fighting in Afghanistan, others in Kashmir. Many had disbanded and many small ones had grouped together. Thousands of seminaries were operating unchecked and churning out crop after crop of young men, brainwashed with a skewed version of religion, and trained in the use of weapons.
As the last Soviet tanks rolled out of Afghanistan, a bloody civil war was already underway. A few years in, no clear winner emerged. It was in the centre of this bloody mess that the Taliban were born. The group swiftly grew, with a little help from their friends, to become the de facto rulers of Afghanistan in 1996. It is also widely alleged that as the Taliban rose to power in southern Afghanistan, they were approached by some friends across the border, who promised active and passive support for the Taliban’s takeover of the country. The rest, as they say, is history.
But the Taliban were not non-state actors in their own backyard. However, their ranks were swelled through a constant flow of personnel from other non-state actors named earlier, which, over time, increased the amount of influence one had over the Taliban. But we digress.
Till this point, Pakistan’s engagement with non-state actors hadn’t caused much trouble. But 9/11 changed everything. Two major events are worth mentioning: First, when the US hammer came down on Afghanistan there was no anvil on the Pakistani side to stem the influx of escaping Al-Qaeda and Taliban personnel. They scurried over the border, pretty much as far into the country as they wanted to. Second, when General Musharraf decided to ‘abandon’ the Taliban, he made two tactical errors: a) he chose to stick with groups which were not operating there; and b) in siding with the US, he created enemies for himself and Pakistan.
This is where and how the violent non-state actor known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan was born.
Why is this history necessary and does it serve any purpose?
Pakistan has a long, chequered and bloody history with the use of non-state actors. Erroneous decisions by people in power and other state institutions have created monsters out of those who once did their bidding.
Is Pakistan going to go the whole nine yards this time? The signs, unfortunately, say no.",negative
"In the present era of global conflict and terrorism, civil liberties and fundamental rights have been put into jeopardy as nation-states have developed means of jettisoning rule of law by introducing anti-terrorism legislation.

Pretexts such as ‘doctrine of necessity’ or special measures for special times have often been cited to justify any deviation from established legal norms and values.

In the aftermath of the world wars, some were in favour of summary executions and punishments without trial. For instance Stalin’s chief prosecutor, Andrei Vyshinsky once suggested during one of the 1938 trials in Moscow: “we can do it just as well without a trial”. Stalin was also said to have “simplified” the judicial system by expanding the death penalty to cover hundreds of offences, eliminating the right to defence, secret trials and suppressing the right to appeal. But there were also people like Harry Truman, albeit a bleak minority, who insisted on due process of law.

US Supreme Court Justice Robert H Jackson, appointed as chief prosecutor, said that “undiscriminating executions or punishments without definite findings of guilt, fairly arrived at, would…. not sit easily well on the American conscience or be remembered by our children with pride.”

The problem remains the same today: how to deal with the ‘bad guys’. But the solutions we take will have different consequences. The fundamental values and human rights which the US once stood for, the American conscience which Justice Jackson spoke of and the due process which President Harry Truman ardently advocated were all jettisoned post the atrocities of 9/11 in an attempt to make the United States of America safer by launching a manhunt on global terrorists.

All of humanity should have felt ashamed when the photographs of the abuse taking place at the Abu Ghraib prison were shown on CBS’ ’60 Minutes’ and shared widely by media across the world. Numerous reports of torture being committed on Guantanamo detainees have surfaced, the most recent one being the Report by the US Senate Committee on Intelligence released on December 9, 2014 which mentions the use of ‘Enhanced Interrogation Techniques’ by the CIA on ‘war on terror’ detainees.

It is pertinent here to address both the legality and the effectiveness of torture as a means of interrogation. Torture has been outlawed in the constitutions of almost every country in the world. The UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Punishment (1984) has 158 state parties, providing an absolute ban on torture; there being ‘no exceptional circumstances whatsoever’ that warrant its use. The 1949 Geneva Conventions also outlaw “mutilation, cruel treatment” and “outrages upon personal dignity”.

However, post-9/11 the ‘ticking time bomb’ hypothesis is oft-cited as an exception, but the question is can a policy be based on a mere hypothetical situation, especially one that puts the very ‘conscience’ of a nation into question? Is there even a single example in contemporary history where a ticking time bomb scenario has actually arisen?

Even if it is accepted that such a situation may arise, torture – once allowed – will be rather impossible to contain; there are always those who will abuse the power vested in them. Another problem is that of the culture of impunity which exists, making sure no one is convicted or punished for torture.

These violations of fundamental rights have blurred the distinction between terrorists and governments that use torture as a strategy to fight terrorism; whatever happened in Abu Ghraib during Saddam Hussain was repeated by the Americans once they had taken over. In order to win a greater war, where psychological warfare is used as a key strategy, one has to have a strong moral standing. The use of torture is not only a moral wrong but also an impediment in winning a greater war against global terrorism.

In terms of effectiveness, there have been instances where even the most hardened terrorists have made confessions under torture. Khalid Sheikh Muhammad for instance could not take water-boarding for more than two and a half minutes and begged to confess. But is such a confession or information extracted by use of torture even reliable in the first place?

The 2014 US Senate Select Committee Report on Intelligence revealed in its findings and conclusions that the CIA had rested on inaccurate claims of effectiveness and essentially impeded oversight by the Congress and the White House. There were many instances of mistaken identities and detention of individuals who did not meet the legal standard for detention. Of the 119 known detainees, at least 26 were wrongfully held and did not meet the detention standard in the September 2001 Memorandum of Notification (MON).

In light of the findings of the US Senate Committee, as well as analysis by policymakers and think tanks worldwide, it can be rightly concluded that torture is not acceptable by any moral calculus whatsoever. Not only is it unlawful but also ineffective. It also helps feed the terrorist agenda which breeds on hatred against the West. In order to win this greater war, countries must stand united and adopt a comprehensive strategy to eradicate terrorism without having to compromise their moral standing.

Lastly, the price of jettisoning rule of law is a fairly high one; short-term successes can inevitably lead to long-term repercussions. It is the right time to decide which model we want to follow in order to fight terrorism – Stalin’s justice or Harry Truman’s ‘rule of law’?

"During the first martial law in 1961 (if we don’t count the riots in 1953), a student was arrested during a Government College strike in Lahore. He was put up in a police cell in Anarkali, where he was soon recognised by the Deputy Commissioner (DC).

After realising whose son he was, the DC rang the chief justice of the West Pakistan High Court. The conversation went as follows:

“Sir, your son Haroon is in police custody. What should we do?”

“Has he committed murder?”

“No, sir.”

“Rape or robbery?”

“No, sir.”

“Some accident or fight?”

“No, sir.”

“Some other sort of violation of law?”

“In a way, yes sir, you would be aware that he is a student leader. He played a prominent role and was arrested, and when I tried to release him he refused to come out saying that others should also be let out. I believe, sir, he has inherited your qualities.”

“For heaven’s sake”, said the judge, “what inheritance are you talking about? I was never in police custody, and I assure you that in this respect my son has gone a step ahead of me.”

“No, sir, I am sorry sir”, the DC said, “I mean that he is too outspoken.”

“Well, well”, the judge said, “if that is a disqualification then I must say that I have some good qualities as well for him to inherit. However, if this is his crime and he has decided to avail of police hospitality for some time, then I have nothing to say. Probably the food at home causes him indigestion.”

And that was that.

Consider this conversation 55 years later; half a century’s worth of presidents and prime ministers, army chiefs and chief justices with a weakness for their kin. To put it charitably.

Yet this should come as little surprise: Malik Rustum Kayani was a rather radical judge, whatever the cost – and the cost was high. Honest, subtle, and sardonic, the judge was the most sought after speaker in his day: his speeches were reported verbatim in the press, not only as masterpieces of innuendo, but as biting satire of the regime.

Assailed by fossils in the bureaucracy, condemned by religious parties in Punjab, and sidelined by a field marshal unused to criticism, the judge carried on in his melancholy way, an army of one.

One with notable success: at a time when the bureaucracy reigned supreme, the writ jurisdiction was seen as a ray of light, where the citizen begged the court’s protection from the whims of the machine. In Justice Kayani, such discretion found its champion. It was a battle the bureaucrats lost.

And earlier on, when rioters took to the streets on the call of Messrs Maududi and Abdus Sattar Niazi in 1953, murdering Ahmadis, it was Justice Kayani who co-authored the Munir Report. “(…) Provided you can persuade the masses to believe that something they are asked to do is religiously right or enjoined by religion”, the report notes, “you can set them to any course of action, regardless of all considerations of discipline, loyalty, decency, morality or civic sense.” The report remains the clearest and bravest indictment of religious ‘subversives’ plaguing our country so many years later.

But unlike Munir, Justice Kayani was as averse to those that knocked the constitution aside. In one wrenching address, the judge recalled being told martial law had been imposed in 1958, and repairing to his garden in shock: ‘”f you have travelled by these airlines where the plane suddenly drops a thousand feet in an air pocket, you will know how I felt.”

Yet after his hilarious, caustic speeches became a part of the culture, the judge from Kohat had stepped on toes too many. In 1962, with martial law at its peak, he was retired without being elevated to the Supreme Court.

As to his relations with the apex court, the judge found an unlikely ally in A R Cornelius a bench above, and the SC seldom disagreed with him. Even in the rare event a decision was overturned, Justice Kayani was little affected. “Sometimes we deliberately make mistakes in order that the Supreme Court may correct them”, he joked, “and out of the hundreds of cases that we have disposed of, the number of lapses can be counted only on our fingers.”

Which brings us to the present; an inversion of the past: not only is the Supreme Court overturning well-settled high court decisions, it’s gone on a spree of reversals of its own precedents laid down mere months ago, Houbara bustard hunting the most known case in point.

Yet rather than allowing the review petitions to be heard before the original bench that made the decision – as per usual – the SC has instead formed larger benches where the original judges are in a minority. As Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed cogently put in another paper, “Just because a later bench disagrees with the analysis of facts or interpretation of law in the original decision is not grounds to reverse it”, and “…A message is sent to all governments and litigants that SC decisions and enunciations of law are not final per se – but only final till the arrival of a more propitious time and a review bench with more amenable judges.”

Given the rapid pace with which the Supreme Court is changing its mind, the good barrister’s suggestions should be taken onboard: replacing the chief justice’s discretion to assign cases with a system where cases are allocated at random, and to constitute larger benches (note: not more judges on multiple smaller benches) which will likely cover more angles and be less susceptible to influence. Should the SC speak consistently, the lower courts may take a clearer cue and decide faster.

During Justice Kayani’s last address to the High Court Bar Association, he said, “The principal thing, however, is that I have no desire to live these thirty-five years of service over again, so full of struggle they have been, so painful in retrospect.” He passed away a month later.

The dispensation of justice is a crushing burden. The Supreme Court, more than any other institution, should be aware of as much.",negative
"It is ironic how one has to describe a crime of the worst kind with a word like ‘honour’. Thus when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif says “there’s no honour in honour killing”, it shows a way forward to the multitude of women who are subject to retrogressive traditions and customs that keep them slaves to a misogynistic society. The prime minister has expressed his desire to make appropriate changes to the relevant law.


It took the nomination of a Pakistani documentary film to the Academy Awards for our representatives to wake up to a tragedy that is a daily occurrence in this country.

According to the statistics available with the Punjab Police, the numbers of ‘honour killings’ for the province of Punjab in the last five years – from 2011 to 2015 – are 256, 184, 275, 312, and 242 respectively. These are cases that somehow found their way to the police stations. There could be many more.

A news report based on an interview with a high-ranking policymaker in Islamabad appeared in this paper a few days ago. The content of the report was less than reassuring. The policymaker was quoted as saying that in the case of honour killings, the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) was being amended to treat the crime of honour killing as ‘Fasad Fil Arz’. This, according to the policymaker, ‘is being done to authorise the court whether to accept or reject a compromise between the complainant and the killer who in most cases of honour killings are blood relations’.

This is a well-meaning but flawed solution. Besides, the law already provides this as a result of an amendment which came into force in January 2005.

So what’s the problem? Consider.

Section 311 of the PPC already declares murder committed in the name of ‘honour’ as Fasad Fil Arz and it also provides that the minimum punishment in such cases shall not be less than ten years of imprisonment. Further, section 338-E provides that any waiver or compounding of such an offence is subject to conditions imposed by the court but with the consent of parties. This amendment was made possible because waiver and compounding are provided in the law where qisas is applicable. And a compromise reached between parties may still be discarded and punishment may be awarded as taazir. A minimum of ten years of imprisonment is prescribed as the secular punishment for ‘honour’ killing. So what went wrong? The problem is more systemic and much deeper than is generally acknowledged – even though it is understood by some.

In 1989, the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court in the Gul Hassan case (1989), an appeal filed by the federal government against an earlier decision of the Federal Shariat Court, declared the then existing punishments and other aspects in the chapter on offences relating to the human body un-Islamic and made eight specific directions in the way the criminal law must be changed to make it Islamic.

As a consequence, the option, among other things, of compounding (compromise as a result of payment of diyat – blood money – for the offence of killing or arsh etc in the case of bodily hurt) and waiver (pardon accepted for the offence of killing or bodily hurt) were introduced in the PPC. Since these options were left entirely – even though in cases of qisas only– to the discretion of the legal heirs of the victims, it has had serious adverse impact on the whole of the criminal justice system.

This has been called the ‘privatisation of justice’, which has impacted even where the court has the discretion to impose secular punishment prescribed in the statute as taazir. It isn’t that compromise between parties was not allowed for certain offences before 1989. But with the Islamic sanction assigned to it, each instance of every offence against human body – including killing, and the so-called ‘honour’ crimes – is now considered to be de facto pardonable or compoundable.

The courts as well as prosecutors are happy to play the role of the post office as they do not have to go through the burdensome challenge of conducting trials. The police are readily inclined to submit documentary evidence of compromise reached between the parties even before the trial begins. This allows them, among other things, to save time and other resources to be spent on investigation, and to act as mediators between the parties. This has practically paved the way for more corruption.

Thus, one sees compromises being reached and money exchanging hands even in rape cases where the law prohibits compromise. This is empowerment of the evil kind. The victims’ relatives are either wary of the system as no justice is expected, at least not speedily, and/or are under pressure from their biradari/clan and their community elders. Once the parties submit a compromise, it works as an automatic trigger.

In the statistics mentioned above, over 90 percent of the cases are estimated to have ended in some kind of compromise – with the perpetrators let off the hook. This is the ‘spill-over effect’ of qisas and diyat laws; and it has literally crippled the system. It is for this reason that the trial courts do not use the existing discretion to award minimum punishment of ten years in the ‘honour’ killings of women as well as men.

If PM Nawaz Sharif is really interested in the welfare of the vulnerable women and men and children of this country, he should make sure that the appropriate kind of amendments are made to the penal code.

Due to the absence of comprehensive, reliable data we do not know the exact scale of the problem of honour killings. Some civil society organisations that monitor honour killings put the numbers at 700-1000 per year for the period 2011-15 for the whole of Pakistan. The actual numbers are estimated to be double – in the range of 1500-2000. Either way, this is a big social problem, not just in terms of the number of human beings killed but also in terms of its social implications. The victims include men but an overwhelming majority in the range of 70-80 per cent or more, of the victims are women.

Every possible step must be taken to eliminate this social evil. Legislation is one of the many important aspects to look into and perhaps is the easiest one. Let’s start with that. Eliminate the discretion currently vested with the court and make all honour crimes mandatorily punishable with no possibility of compromise between the parties.

"The minister for education has written an opinion defending the Single National Curriculum (‘Debating the SNC’, The News, September 8, 2020). It fails in its objectives but I am grateful to the minister for providing a revealing insight into what governments in Pakistan think and desire and how they work.

First, the latter, taking the SNC as illustrative of policymaking – substituting the chicken-and-hen scheme or CPEC – just reiterates the point. Governments make policy behind closed doors with manufactured consensus and announce it as a done deal. If there is a storm of protest, it is considered a substitute for the debate that should have taken place during the deliberation on the policy.

The so-called ‘debate’ is negotiated with a lot of hand waving, parrying every question with an answer, usually incoherent and mutually contradictory, confident in the knowledge that given the balance of power not an iota is going to be changed in the policy. And there is no budging from the one-sided claim that the policy is absolutely the best in the word.

So it is with the SNC, crafted by the fabulous 400, whose date of implementation has been announced, the contract for the model textbook awarded, and which is declared to be “outstanding” and “as good as any.” Meanwhile the pseudo-debate rolls on, the arguments falling on deaf ears.

The minister says “we studied many international curricula and also got feedback from Cambridge. We also had help from professionals of some major educational institutions of the country.”

But he is not willing to disclose which international curriculum forms the basis for the SNC, what was asked of Cambridge and what was the response, and who were the professionals from the major educational institutions of the country. (We do know that Bill Gates was the one who blessed the chicken-and-egg scheme that was to address poverty much as the SNC is intended to address inequality.)

This is par for the course and we have lived with it for over 70 years in many reinvented versions of Naya Pakistan. But what is of much greater interest is what the government thinks and that can be read so clearly in the minister’s narrative. The minister claims that different types of schools lead to “different worldviews” and these different worldviews have contributed to our “internal conflicts.” That is rather amusing when one views all the bitter conflicts taking place between those who have been to exactly the same schools – all the Aitchisonians and enlightened Oxbridge Blues abusing each other and at each other’s throats, all educated in the Queen’s English from day one and singing Jack and Jill to impress visitors from abroad.

So the minister believes an attempt should be made to reduce these “perceptual divisions” to minimise “conflict in society” and he thinks the SNC is the way to achieve that “desirable state.” No wonder, he concludes “national curricula are prescribed in almost every developed country. The list is endless but France, UK, most of Europe, China, Japan etc all have a national curriculum.”

What can one say in the face of the Chinese having to put their ethnic minorities into reeducation camps despite the national curriculum, the French having to crack down on the Yellow Vests as well as deal with Marie Le Pen, and the UK having to negotiate a desirable state with the Irish and the Scots. How naive can one get? If all it took to get to a desirable state was a national curriculum, wouldn’t Donald Trump be hugging Barack Obama?

After all that big talk, the apologia that follows is both mind-boggling and heartbreaking: “It has been correctly pointed out that the disparities in our education system are not just because of the curriculum. The environment, the facilities, the teaching standards, and in many cases the home environment are fundamentally different. This is true. Making all schools somewhat equal is an impossible task.”

“But that does not mean that no attempt should be made to at least prescribe the same learning standards, benchmarks, and outcomes, in a common language, for all children. This would give everyone a somewhat equal opportunity – perfectly equal is impossible.” “The single national curriculum is an attempt to level the playing field somewhat.”

I am touched immensely by the three ‘somewhats’ that tell the entire story. How has it been determined that the most effective measure to level the playing field is the curriculum and not the environment, the facilities, the teaching standard and the home environments that are “fundamentally different”? And if the government really wants to level the playing field fast (are you kidding?) why not just switch tomorrow to having all entrance exams in local languages as well as English? Why change the curriculum and wait 15 years before the playing field starts getting leveled ‘somewhat’?

As for the SNC being “outstanding” and “as good as any,” how is that claim to be validated? Is the minister’s word enough when a whole host of experts in education argue that is actually very bad? The eminent educationist, Dr Tariq Rehman, has this to say: “Let me be blunt for a change: I think this pursuit of sameness in the name of equity and justice is a blunder…. it is a dark alley we are entering. I hope I am wrong but this is my honest opinion.”

This is a dire warning based on sober reflection and spoken from the heart. It is shared by many others. The only honest resolution of the disagreement is to submit the SNC to a panel of independent experts in early childhood education and to abide by their verdict. The dishonest resolution is to start casting aspersions on the critics and calling them names. But, as we also know from over 70 years of experience in Pakistan, honesty does not come cheap in this country.

The minister’s narrative makes very sad reading. This tried-and-failed belief, which flies in the face of all evidence, that making everyone think alike is the solution to the very real problems caused by think-alike authoritarian elites squabbling with each other to see who can rip off the most in the least time is intellectually depressing. It is a sign, in the words of the minister, of “effete intellectualism that does not take into account realities on the ground.”

"Before I list my problems with the Single National Curriculum (SNC), let me accept that its proponents are completely well-intentioned and want the best for our children. But let me also add the caveat, to which all reasonable people would agree, that good intentions by themselves are never sufficient as a justification. Good intentions can also lead to terrible disasters.

No one can doubt the good intentions of Mr Jinnah. Yet his decision to impose a single national language set a tragedy in motion. Such disasters do not distinguish between the secular and the religious. History will be the judge of what Gen Zia’s educational interventions have done to this country. The liberal Mr Musharraf was no doubt well-intentioned when he led the country into Kargil.

Intentions are irrelevant in the end and only those who are unable to defend their positions on grounds of logic and coherence assume a self-righteous posture construing criticism as an affront to their intentions. Intentions are particularly irrelevant when the stakes are as high as they are with an eduction policy for the country. The lives of millions of children will be set on a path from which there wil be no return for the cohorts who are launched on it.

Given the stakes, the first signal of good faith would be to involve the entire country in the discussion. There is no justification for presenting a fait accompli with already determined dates of implementation and prescribed model textbooks. A non-transparent process with no participation of the actual stakeholders and no disclosure of its deliberations is a sure sign the proponents are afraid the output would not stand scrutiny from either the public or experts in early childhood education.

This lack of confidence in the product is obvious from the weak arguments being put forward in its defence. Yes, 400 people were involved but who were they? Were there experts in early childhood education? Or were there only politicians, bureaucrats, school owners, textbook publishers, madressah managers and the like?

Yes, the provincial governments might have signed off but how much confidence should one repose in the legislators who signed off on the Tahaffuz-e-bunyad-e Islam bill without reading it?

The clearest sign the proponents feel unable to defend the SNC is the pushing of the religious button, a time-tested strategy of last resort. The critics are damned as belonging to a tiny secular elite (ashraafiya) that still honours Mr Jinnah’s statement that religion has “nothing to do with the business of the state.” (Note how the intentions of the critics are being questioned – what is sauce for the goose is obviously not sauce for the gander.) The proponents, themselves as much a part of the ashraafiya as the critics and by no means ajlaf or, God forbid, arzal, are, by contrast, Islam-loving, more one presumes in the Khadim Rizvi camp.

The proponent ashraafiya is happy to enlighten the critical ashraafiya (by gratuitous labelling) that the hopelessly confused Mr Jinnah was overruled first by the very-Islamic Gen Ziaul Haq and then set right by the National Assembly in 2016 which determined that even more religion ought to be taught in schools. This determination is held to be sacrosanct even though the rest of the assembly’s intentions are castigated, it being damned for belonging to a government of thieves. It is not even asked if these members, most of whom are still around – albeit having taken a new vow of honesty – bothered to read what they were signing off on in their dishonest days. Not likely, if their Punjab brethren are an example to go by.

In defence of the SNC, we are told that it is nothing new – it just builds on the one put in place in 2006 by an unrepresentative government itself among those responsible for the very sorry state of education today. But if the state of education is so poor where is the evaluation of the 2006 curriculum that is partly responsible for that outcome? And what makes one believe the same departmental functionaries who masterminded it with laudatory proclamations would now come up with something radically better by tinkering at the margins?

What exactly is the SNC supposed to do? It began with the objective of creating musaawat (equality). But now we are told there is no intention to reduce choice in the types of schools in existence. In defence of this backtracking the seemingly clever argument is proffered that even in America it has been impossible to equalize the quality of schools. How can a poor country like Pakistan attempt something so impossible?

This argument conveniently ignores the fact that the foundational principle of the American system is inequality which is considered a good thing leading to dynamism, entrepreneurship, and the like. Failure is the responsibility of individuals who do not work hard enough. America has never staked a goal of musaawat or of using its system of education to turn the country into the Riasat of Medina. Hiding behind any incoherent argument that comes to hand is a sure sign that good intentions cannot make up for cognitive dissonance and intellectual confusion.

So, if the quality of schools can vary as before, what would the SNC achieve? What children learn (not memorize – the two are distinct) is less a function of the curriculum and more of the quality of teachers, the environment at home, and the availability of resources. How much can a curriculum matter when the basic learning outcomes in cognitive skills are more or less standardized? Systems that have evolved to maximize the cognitive abilities of children, like Montessori and Waldorf, let them learn more or less through play without making them memorize anything they are unable to imagine.

The bottom line is that the lives of millions of children is at stake and there is no margin for making a mistake – no matter how well-intentioned. The principal stakeholders are children who are unfortunately unable to articulate their opinion, positive or negative, on the SNC. Given that, it is an ethical imperative to consult in good faith with their parents who have dreams for their children, wish the best for them, and invest hard-earned incomes in their education. Do not presume what parents want their children to learn. Find it out; it is not difficult. Do not be afraid of what experts would think of the SNC. Find it out; it is not difficult.

The future of the country depends on the education of the coming generations. A test of good intentions and of confidence in the SNC is a very wide consultation. This is not the time to hide behind religion and divide the country between one kind of elite and another because, when elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled.

Note that the draft of the New Education Policy that was coincidentally just approved in India was open for public discussion for 18 months and received over a quarter of million inputs. Before this phase, two draft committee reports were released as interim documents for perusal by all citizens. You don’t have to be a religious person to do something sensible.

Is the big rush in Pakistan an acknowledgement that the SNC will not stand public scrutiny? Is it a contemptuous signal that in Pakistani democracy it is still power and not argument that rules the day.

"The mandate of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) should now be to save higher education in Pakistan but quite aside from the fact that past actions of the HEC are responsible for the present state, I think the tipping point, much like that for climate change, has been crossed. Mir Taqi Mir would have equated the proposition with seeking a cure from the same apothecary’s son responsible for the ailment

Now when I think of either, I can’t help thinking of Fitzgerald’s rendering of Omar Khayyam’s quatrain:

“The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,/Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit/ Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,/Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.”

I have said it before and have no reason to change my mind that disastrous as operations like Gibraltar, Searchlight, and Badr were for the wellbeing of Pakistan, their damage was reversible. But the havoc that the HEC has wrought is not, simply because it has institutionalized mediocrity and mendacity and made sure that each succeeding generation of Pakistanis, on whom the future of the country depends, will be worse prepared than before. Locusts visit the country once in a decade and are considered a menace to agriculture. The HEC has ensured that all too many locusts are permanently installed in the hallways of higher education eating away its innards at will.

Where are the wise kings who set up this institution? They should all be brought into the dock and made to read from Shelley:

“My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;/ Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!/ Nothing beside remains. Round the decay/ Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare/ The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

In case you wish to sample hell on earth, do sign up to be a referee for a Master’s thesis at many of the diploma mills the HEC has licensed as universities. If you wish to be reinvited you are required to pass the candidate. If you don’t, you are reminded by the faculty that “This is Pakistan”; one can’t be too strict here. A statement of pride has become one of apology.

Nine times out of ten, the thesis makes no sense whatsoever. There is no hypothesis and even if there is, it has little to do with the work. The English is close to gibberish. Through all this, one can sense that the student is not entirely brain dead, that he or she is struggling to express some thoughts.

A helpful suggestion to let the student write the thesis in a language that he or she might be more comfortable with is dismissed righteously as an assault on “our standards” – gibberish in English being valued more highly than quasi-sense in a local language. A suggested compromise to let the student write in a language of choice and have the thesis translated into English for submission after approval to comply with “our standards” is rejected because it would impose a cost on the student. This, after charging a fee for two years to teach virtually nothing, not even how to write passable English.

What is quite obvious from suffering through such an excruciating exercise is that the fault is not of the student. It is an abject failure of supervision. My charitable guess is that the supervisor has not bothered to read the thesis and never had any meeting at any juncture during its writing. At best, some handout has been passed out with directions for what is expected. Amongst the incentives the geniuses at the HEC have institutionalized to “promote” “cutting-edge” research are bonus payments per paper published and student supervised.

Anywhere else in the world this is part of the regular work of an academic. Anyone with any sense should have been able to point out the perversities inherent in such incentives especially where abusing incentives has become the norm. The rampant plagiarism of papers, proliferation of fake journals, and exploitation of supervisees is an unsurprising outcome.

This is the reason I think higher education is beyond the point of no return in Pakistan. These kinds of supervisors must have been students from an earlier generation who must have been passed because “This is Pakistan.” And the students they pass in turn will become the supervisors of the next generation. No amount of tinkering at the edges will negate the deadening weight of this human capital that has already swarmed over most of the higher education landscape in the country.

There is only one radical solution, but it is beyond the reach of the HEC – even though I am sure many there recognise the necessity. Anyone half in earnest should place all the Master’s level theses awarded by Pakistani universities in an open access archive and send a random sample of them to a panel outside the country for evaluation. The supervisors of all theses rejected by the panel should be instantly dismissed and any institution with a higher than five percent rejection rate should be closed down. Then one can begin to pick up the pieces.

This seems a drastic measure but drastic situations need drastic solutions. It is in line with the much milder proposal of Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy that all the course material being used for online teaching be placed in an open access archive so that we may know who is teaching from notes dating back to 1976. And we know what happened to Dr Hoodbhoy.",negative
"The coronavirus pandemic is bad enough but, as dozens of countries have demonstrated, it can be controlled – there were just three new cases in Sri Lanka on June 12.

Even in places where the number of infected persons was very large before the alert was sounded, Italy for example, new cases per day have dropped from 6,557 on March 21 to 163 on June 12. In Pakistan, they continue to rise – from 144 on March 21 to 6,397 on June 12. What makes the pandemic so recalcitrant in Pakistan, where the initial cases were minimal for lack of tourists, are the epidemics within the epidemics.

The first of these is the blight of ignorance. A country where the majority cannot verify information for itself is hugely handicapped. All it should take is a visit to one of the many data sites (worldometers.info is excellent) to look up the trends on new and active cases, recoveries, and deaths for any country. A cursory glance would reveal the declining trends for most and, by contrast, the alarming upward slope for Pakistan.

Just this one glimpse would dispel all rampant doubts and conspiracies and convince people that we are now entering seriously troubled territory. And, it would make people realize that we really have nothing in place to arrest this inexorable upward trend. Some familiarity with exponential growth would remove the complacency induced by the slow start of an epidemic which can be foolishly equated with road deaths and the like. One would know that even small numbers accumulate relentlessly – Pakistan is now amongst the countries with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world.

The slightly more aware observer would also note the ominous inflexion point in the trends for Pakistan right around May 30. Take the number of active cases which were 40,931 on that day. It had taken 21 days to double to that number from 20,291 on May 19. It took less than 13 days to double again to 83,223 by June 12. The rate of increase is rising, not falling. Now recall that Eid was on May 23. It shouldn’t take a genius to put two and two together. The very benevolent allowance to shop till you drop before Eid and the even more generous extended holiday to go home and hug your loved ones has shown up inevitably in the May 30 inflexion point.

Consider by contrast how China handled the 40-day new year holidays in which about three billion trips are made in a normal year. Once again, the charts will reveal the amazing fact that there was virtually no outbreak in any province outside Hubei where the epidemic erupted.

The kind of numerical illiteracy that exists in Pakistan is to be blamed squarely on its rulers who have not invested in meaningful education and kept the population steeped in myths. But that is another story needing separate attention. For the moment, it can be mitigated only if the population has enough trust in its government to take on faith what they are being told and do what they are advised in their interest.

Here too, a double strike is at work. The people have no trust in their leaders who have compounded the problem by saying contradictory things at different times including the suggestion that the pandemic is a visitation of divine wrath for allowing women to dress immodestly.

An inevitable consequence of the blight of ignorance, lack of trust in leaders, and the ridiculous melange of messages from the latter, is the epidemic of rumours whose transmission rate outpaces that of the virus by many orders of magnitude. There is hardly any theory that has not been promoted via a relentless barrage of social media messages. As a result, it is hard to find a person who takes the pandemic seriously for what it is, a health crisis threatening the lives of thousands of essential workers and an economic crisis that would plunge millions deeper into poverty.

A consequence of all this is the bizarre interplay of two other epidemics – paralysing fear and false bravado. Some families are locked up, having sent their help away. Others continue to mill around confident that nothing can happen to the God-fearing. The polarizing opposition of the former demanding an extended lockdown and the latter deriding it as folly has put paid to any sensible discussion of what could be done.

Add to this the slow spreading epidemic of incompetence that starting in the 1970s has now percolated right through to the top. A befuddled government steering without a rudder is now telling people they are on their own after lulling them with do-not-worry platitudes. A minister pronounces what everyone knows – cases will hit 1.2 million by end-July. So, what’s the plan? The prime minister will personally ensure SOPs are followed and hit the violators hard. It is a lethal combination whose outcome can be in little doubt.

Yet another epidemic, that of hot air, has gripped the intellectuals. Every institution with fancy pretensions has come alive with webinars and Covid-bulletins as if mortally afraid they will be held to account for sitting idle while death ravaged the land. Never mind that no one reads the bulletins, least of all those for whom they are intended, and most webinars just have retired luminaries shooting the breeze recalling how they worked miracles in past crises. Add to them various ex-ministers who harangue people to do what they had not done themselves when in power.

All in all, it is a right terrible mess, the cost of which is borne by those without the luxury to work from home or the economic cushion to turn the break into an extended retreat to further their intellectual horizons. Arundhati Roy has vowed the first thing she would do once the epidemic is over is organize a public trial. In Pakistan, we should begin with a public investigation into the border fiasco that let the virus infiltrate and run rampant in the country.",negative
"The relatively low number of Covid-19 deaths reported in South Asia continue to puzzle analysts. While the low numbers might be true for reasons yet to be fully confirmed, there are now serious charges of undercounting.

Reports of undercounting have been circulating in India for a while but now an investigative piece in the London Telegraph has leveled charges of deliberate malfeasance. It claims to have seen written orders to a West Bengal hospital that in case of Covid-positive determinations, the cause is not to be recorded on death certificates. A doctor at a government hospital in Cooch Behar is reported as saying: ""We were ordered to strictly refrain from using the word 'Corona' in the death certificates until it gets a nod from the state government's opaque committee.” In Pakistan, doctors told the newspaper that “deaths were being undercounted because of stigma around the disease and public resentment at strict burial regulations.”

Such charges need investigation without delay. If proven false, it would validate the low mortality rate and enable the countries to confidently move towards resumption of normal life with necessary precautions. If true, the danger of a looming unmanageable and damaging crisis becomes very real. Undercounting, by promoting a sense of complacency, does not do anyone any good. Truth will out in the end simply because the dead do not disappear.

This suggests a very simple, inexpensive, and transparent check – COUNT THE DEAD.

This is the check that is signalling trouble in India. Staff at a crematorium near Kolkata say “we used to cremate 15 to 20 bodies usually in a week, prior to the arrival of Covid. But now we receive that number of dead bodies in a single day.” The municipal corporations of Delhi have reported 426 corona positive cremations or burials while the Delhi government’s official bulletin has reported 194 Covid deaths during the same period. In Ahmedabad, a graveyard reported 376 burials in the first 25 days of May compared to just 61 in the same period last year.

Similar trends have been noticed in other places. Moscow has reported 20 percent higher fatalities in April 2020 compared to its average April mortality total over the past decade. In New York City, between March 11 and May 2, “there have been 23,000 more deaths than would normally be expected, while only 18,706 deaths have been reported from Covid-19, suggesting that up to 4,300 additional people may have died from the virus.” In Paris, March-April deaths were 89 percent in excess of the same period in 2019 but in early May the excess had fallen to just six percent as the epidemic was controlled.

A very simple first check would be to count the total number of burials in Lahore and Karachi starting from the date the first case was reported and compare them with the same-period averages over the past few years. Any significant deviation from the norm should trigger an alert for further investigations. The burial counts would also be tallied against the numbers reported by the city authorities to address the concerns about undercounting.

Needless to say, the number of burials would need to be adjusted for inadvertent impacts of the lockdown – fewer deaths because of reduced environmental pollution and vehicular traffic and increased deaths because of lack of access to medical care for non-Covid diseases. These adjustments are not difficult to make but may not be needed initially. Any significant deviation from comparable periods in previous years would alert authorities to some abnormality. On the other hand, the absence of an upswing could suggest that even if the infection was spreading (something that cannot be confirmed without large-scale testing), it was not resulting in an above-average number of deaths or hospitalizations. This would provide a platform for further analysis.

My attempts at pursuing this inquiry have been stymied because most graveyards in Lahore and Karachi either do not retain this information or are unwilling to release it. This is quite in keeping with the tradition where either data is not valued or every minor piece of it is treated like a state secret whose key is tucked away in the waistband of someone with no respect for research.

This harmless data should be in the public domain and readily accessible as it has been in other countries for hundreds of years. Daniel Defoe’s account of the 1665-1666 plague in London (‘A Journal of the Plague Year’) begins with a listing of the weekly bills of death posted by the infected parishes in the city. The contemporaneous diary of Samuel Pepys of the same plague mentions the “bills of mortality,” the weekly tallies of burials printed by the Company of Parish Clerks in London.

My request to those who are forever blabbering about transforming Pakistan into the cutting edge of global research is to start by paying attention to the little things. City authorities should mandate graveyards to release what information they have and to immediately begin recording burials if they are not doing so already. Count the dead because in this case the dead may have tales to tell.",negative
"The last shred of doubt regarding the reality of climate change should have been removed by the unnaturally early arrival of the silly season. One warming outcome has seen the hot air balloon of the Pakistani economy lifting off into the stratosphere without anyone ever noticing what happened.

First, there was the upward draft in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and the Washington Post that removed the veil from the transformation that we had failed to observe. Not wanting to leave anything to our blinkered visions, the WSJ blared it all out in one breathless headline: ‘Pakistan’s Middle Class Soars as Stability Returns: Consumer spending rockets as poverty shrinks, terrorism drops and democracy holds’.

Before the excitement could die down and lest a couple of eyebrows be raised, the redoubtable Economist added the gravity of its authoritative voice with an article, titled ‘Pakistan confronts something unfamiliar: optimism’, thereby reiterating that we were too befogged to see what was happening before our eyes.

Leave aside the fact that the land wouldn’t know real pessimism if it were staring it in the face, it is largely populated with optimists of which one can count three types. The first category consists of those who can only be called ‘resigned optimists’ as they subscribe to the philosophy that everything will come out good in the end because we are God’s chosen people. And who can quarrel with them given that the nation has survived the most incredible stupidities that any ruling class can visit on a country.

The second category comprises the ‘oppositional optimists’ who indulge in temporary pessimism only because it is not their charioteer that is leading the charge. Give a chance to the theocrats or the autocrats or the bureaucrats or the cricket bats and watch how we emerge roaring as the tiger of Asia if not of the entire world. The third category consists of the ‘incorrigible optimists’ who really need no excuse to feel positive. After soberly recalling all the gross errors committed over the past 70 years and recounting all the obvious but unfortunately missed chances, he or she arrives inevitably at the cheerful “I remain staunchly optimistic” conclusion. For this set, optimism need not be based on any evidence. It is more a genetic trait like green eyes – one is just born with it. Press them a bit and they will pluck anything out of the air as the reason for their buoyancy – a very youthful population would do as well as anything else. Never mind we haven’t invested a penny in potty training.

For the Economist “a cricket match and an obscure administrative reform” in Fata are sufficient signs for the great leap forward. Add to that the handy standby: “Pakistan’s stock market has risen faster than any other in Asia over the past 12 months, by a heady 50 percent.” Heady, indeed. For years, the Economist has been warning of dreaded bubbles underlying the heady rise of the Chinese stock market but no such qualms are warranted in the case of Pakistan – even as its own regulator cracks down on malpractices in the exchange. It is all a matter of the balloon one wishes to float.

One does wonder though what caused the Economist to so radically change its story. It was just a couple of months back that it posted its last roundup of the Pakistani economy under the title ‘Roads to nowhere: Pakistan’s misguided obsession with infrastructure’ with the despairing subtitle “the government is building more airports, roads and railways, even though the existing ones are underused”.

The article labelled our last great economic corridor, the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway, a “$1.2b white elephant” and compared the prime minister to Sher Shah Suri. It ended with dripping sarcasm: “the railways minister, recently admitted to parliament that the country would not be getting a bullet train after all. “When we asked the Chinese about it, they laughed at us,” he said.”

The Economist clearly doesn’t expect most Pakistanis to pay attention to what they read. The conclusion to its suddenly upbeat and optimistic gushing notes with genuine surprise: “For Pakistan, however, even to be debating the subject is encouraging”.

Just to prove wrong the allegations that Pakistanis are unable to recognise optimism when they see it, a motley set of experts jumped into the fray, adding colour to the silly season. Some excoriated the detractors for failing to appreciate the economic takeoff. Others claimed that we were already much richer than we believed. Yet others asserted that poverty was a thing of the past. I can only presume that the malnourished children – nearly half of all children in the country – must be so because their parents have better things to do with their wealth much as the unemployment in the Great Depression had been an outcome of the voluntary trade-off between work and leisure.

Wake up Pakistan: feudalism is dead, we are all urban now, poverty is licked, every city is a growling tiger cub and the Chinese are coming. The writing is on the wall. “Yes, how many times can a man turn his head/Pretending he just doesn’t see?/The answer my friend is blowin’ in the wind/The answer is blowin’ in the wind.”

Think what you may. It is the silly season. It is the season for feeling good. March madness has barely ended. April is the kindest month in our part of the world. But still, why the obsession with the economy? Why not just fly a kite?",negative
"For weeks we have not seen the sun in Lahore. There is light without sunshine, diffused as through a dull haze. And we are trudging along as if this is the norm, an inevitable part of our fate.

In Lahore, nobody cares enough to even tell us what we are living through but we can get some sense from the news filtering out of Delhi – so near and yet so far – where the chief minister has labelled the city a ‘gas chamber.’ A public health emergency has been declared, five million masks are being distributed in schools which have been closed for two days, construction work has been halted for a week, an odd-even scheme imposed to cut traffic pollution, and many firms are advising their employees to stay home.

The level of dangerous particulates in the air is about 20 times the maximum specified by the World Health Organization. The particulate matter PM2.5 that affects the lungs has reached 533 micrograms per cubic metre in the city while WHO recommends that it not exceed 25 micrograms per cubic metre on average per day.

What the levels are in Lahore we don’t know. What they are doing to us we don’t know. We do know from the science learnt in schools that if plants do not get sunshine, they cannot produce chlorophyll and will lose their green colour and eventually die. Is something similar happening to us that we are unaware of? Are we swallowing some poisons that will turn us sallow and consign us to premature deaths?

The irony in all this is that we know very well the main cause of this condition. In the case of Delhi, half the pollution, visible from satellite photos, is due to stubble smoke (“a lethal cocktail of particulate matter, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide”) generated by farmers burning crop residues to clear their fields in neighbouring states – “more than two million farmers burn 23 million tonnes of crop residue on some 80,000 sq km of farmland in northern India every winter.” This is surely a cause that can be addressed by policy measures especially when the health of millions is at stake.

Why is there such a stark lack of urgency to act on this environmental catastrophe and to initiate the obvious policy measures that would mitigate it to a considerable extent? Why is this not a subject of urgent debate in the hallways of power?

One can’t help but think that in Pakistan we are confronted with an even more vicious malady. One can’t help but think that our politics itself is a politics without sunshine. For decades we have been enveloped in the noxious fumes of pollutants in the form of politicians and various species of their hangers-on. These polluting agents have been sucking the life out of us, going about the business of enriching themselves without a care for our wellbeing. We may be ravaged by smog or floods or earthquakes or dirty water or fecal contamination or malnutrition – it matters not the least to them.

How else can we explain how far we have been left behind? We cannot provide clean water to our citizens. We cannot provide decent education. We cannot provide good health. We cannot provide adequately paying jobs. We cannot provide livable housing. We cannot provide public transport. We cannot provide reliable electricity. We cannot provide honest public services. We cannot even provide hope of a better future. All that is on offer is mindless rhetoric regurgitated by highly compensated sinecures, rhetoric that can be swallowed much like the highly lethal particulate matter circulating in the air.

How can we restore the sunshine in our political lives? It seems impossible given the entrenched army of parasites that clings to and stifles every putative saviour and bends him or her to their self-serving ends. Perhaps these parasites feel they have the wherewithal to fly away on helicopters for good when the day of doom finally arrives. Till then they can plunder and extract the nation’s resources at will, siphoning them to safe havens while taking turns at the helm. There is no sunshine and, in this case, not even the faintest of lights at the end of the tunnel.

Is it possible to think, in our fevered states, that this political malady might also have a cause much like the stubble whose burning is causing the smog in our cities? Is there something that is generating and nurturing and perpetuating the political pollution and keeping it in play? In our lucid moments, the moments we can spare from the travails of surviving in the deathly air, we can almost point in the right direction. Perhaps, when enough fingers are pointing in the same direction, the sun shall burst forth and there will be light.",negative
"Education is a big-ticket item. Clarity is needed about its relationship with economic growth and development before betting the house on it. Otherwise a lot of resources would end up being misallocated.

It is in this context that I respond to Mr Miftah Ismail’s diagnosis and prescription presented in his opinion in this newspaper (‘Educating Pakistan,’ December 5, 2018). Mr Ismail begins by asking why any country is richer than another and answers with the assertion that “education is probably the most important factor in determining the wealth of nations.” From this follows the prescription that the path to richness is education.

I offer some cross-country evidence using literacy rates as a proxy for education and GDP per capita as a proxy for wealth – for each country the data that follows in parentheses shows the percentage of adult population that is literate and GDP per capita in US dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity. Consider the pair Uzbekistan (100; $6,856) and Mongolia (98; $13,000): the latter is almost twice as wealthy at about the same level of education. Now consider Pakistan (58; $5,527) and Bangladesh (73; $3,869): the former is actually wealthier at a lower level of education. Consider Myanmar (76; $6,139) which is one-and-a-half times wealthier than Bangladesh at almost the same level of education and comparable in wealth to Pakistan despite having a considerably higher level of education.

For historical evidence, consider the fact that in the year 1700 India had 25 percent of the world’s wealth with virtually no literacy. How did that happen if wealth is the outcome of education? This share dropped to 6 percent by 2015, despite increasing education for a host of unrelated reasons that cannot be ignored in drawing conclusions about the relationship between education and wealth. It is equally important to be aware that both in 1700 and in 2015, wealth in India was not widely distributed but was concentrated in very few hands.

The bottom line is that there is no simple correlation between education and wealth and it is incorrect to derive such a conclusion by looking at education levels in developed countries like Japan while ignoring the many other factors that might have been more critical like, for example, the Meiji reforms of 1868. Nor is there a simple relationship between wealth and its distribution. Leaving aside the accidents of history, many, more crucial, factors can determine a country’s development path of which the policy framework is paramount. While it is true that China invested in education, its growth dynamic was triggered by the policy changes in 1979 while earlier, despite the education, it had suffered unimaginable catastrophes during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

This last point highlights the damning inference that it is disingenuous to blame lack of mass education for lack of development, which is primarily due to misgovernance. Keep in mind that all policy decisions are taken not by illiterate citizens but by well-educated rulers. Just like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution in China, Pakistan’s policies to promote fundamentalism and hostility towards neighbours are solely attributable to its well-educated ruling classes. While Chinese leaders learnt from their mistakes, Pakistan’s rulers remain enmeshed in their mindless jingoism and container thought. It is naive to hope that mere education can get them out of this mess of their own creation.

The greater irony is that the kind of education being promoted by Pakistan’s elite is exacerbating and not alleviating the problems of misdevelopment. Fundamentalism and intolerance are the more obvious outcomes of an education designed not to encourage creativity but to buttress a chimerical national identity rooted in fear and arrogance. One must remain cognizant of the difference between the quantity of education and its quality.

It is also true that the PML-N did little for education during its tenure. Go over the list of heads of educational institutions appointed during that period and it becomes obvious that improving education was not the motivation. Little was done to regulate private colleges that are nothing more than diploma mills turning out graduates without any prospects of employment. And higher education remained plagued by the virus of plagiarism in which the executive director appointed by the government to the watchdog institution, the Higher Education Commission, was himself complicit.

The article also asserts that “for some reason education is not very valued by our modern culture.” This is not in keeping with the back-breaking sacrifices made by poor parents to put their children through school and simultaneously pay for supplemental tuition to compensate for the low quality of the latter. This, despite the fact that returns to education are very low in Pakistan where connections matter more than knowledge or merit.

It has also been claimed, citing Aristotle, that “if parents do their jobs and raise their children well, in one generation all of society’s problems will go away. Every citizen would be educated, decent, kind and well mannered.” How one wishes this were true. What proportion of the set of educated people in positions of authority today is decent, kind and well-mannered? The educated who routinely slap and mistreat low-paid public servants and use foul language in public discourse offer sufficient contrary evidence to challenge this claim.

Good and meaningful education is a basic human right which ought to be pursued for its own sake and not for any instrumental reasons. It is essential for individuals to live fulfilling lives to which they are entitled by virtue of being born. It is a grave failure of the state to have deprived the majority of its people of good education for so many decades. It is adding insult to injury to attempt to pass the buck for this neglect and criminal misgovernance of the ruling class onto powerless people, an allegedly apathetic culture and parental negligence.

The first step towards a better future requires the state to own responsibility for the welter of serious problems enmeshing the country of which lack of education is only one. The problem is not that people do not value education; it is the abuse of education for patronage, profits, and political ends. This abuse needs to end before the journey to development can begin.",negative
"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has issued a notification allowing Discos to collect Rs 0.4828/unit extra from the power consumers in their electricity bills of November.

This decision has been taken under the monthly fuel price adjustment for the month of August 2020. This is a one-time collection and only for November. This amount will be collected from the power consumers of all Discos in their November electricity bills. However, the K-Electric is exempt from its applicability. Lifeline consumers whose consumption is up to 50 units/month will also not pay it. Its impact will be Rs 7 billion.

According to the notification, the fuel cost per unit of electricity production in August was Rs3.68 while the advance fuel cost was fixed at Rs3.20 per unit in August. Furthermore, the additional collection shall be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in August 2020. Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of August 2020 in the billing month of November 2020.

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) on behalf of Discos had filed the petition to the regulator. It had asked for permission to charge Rs 0.9846/unit from the consumers having a total impact of Rs14 billion. On September 30, the hearing was held on this case. The authority deducted Rs404 million on account of previous adjustments and Rs6.6 billion on a provisional basis on account of the operation of plants on RFO/HSD from the cost claimed by the CPPA.

The authority during the hearing observed that prima facie, certain efficient power plants were not fully utilized and instead energy from costlier RFO & HSD-based power plants was generated to the tune of over Rs 11.594 billion (Rs 9.694 billion from RFO and Rs l.9 billion from HSD-based power plants) in August 2020.

The authority noted that had this energy been generated from other cheaper sources like RLNG or coal, this would have resulted in a reduction in total fuel cost claimed by the CPPA-G.

The authority has been directing the NPCC/NTDC and CPPA-G repeatedly to provide complete justification in this regard, to the satisfaction of the authority, and submit complete details for a generation made on RFO/HSD, showing hourly generation along with the financial impact for deviation from EMO, if any, and the reasons, thereof.

The Nepra, after analyzing the data, decided that the additional impact of operation of RFO/HSD plants is around Rs 6.655 billion. The authority did not allow this amount to the CPAA and asked it to submit hourly detailed data of RFO/HSD power generation of plants.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s weekly sensitive price indicator (SPI) inched up 1.38 per cent over the previous week, mainly due to increase in food prices especially tomatoes, onion, sugar and some other kitchen items, official data showed on Tuesday.

The SPI for the week ending on Oct 29, increased by 9.68 per cent compared to weekly inflation in the corresponding week a year earlier, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported. Last week, it was recorded at 8.76 per cent.

Having a cursory look at the SPI bulletin, the lowest income slab was the hardest hit compared to the affluent spending group. The SPI for the expenditure group (quintile 1), spending up to Rs17,732/month was 12.76 per cent, while for the group spending more than 44,175/month, it recorded at 8.31 per cent.

The PBS data showed that average prices of 17 items (33.33 per cent) registered an increase, seven items (13.72 per cent) registered decrease, while prices of 27 items (52.94 per cent) did not show any change.

The SPI comprises 51 essential items and the prices are collected from 50 markets in 17 cities of the country. In a span of one week, tomato prices increased by 47 per cent to Rs198/kg, onions 6 per cent to Rs74/kg, sugar 4.18 per cent to Rs103.47/kg, bananas 2.8 per cent to Rs63.3/dozen, potatoes 2.6 per cent to Rs71.4/kg, LPG by one per cent to Rs1340/11.6kg cylinder, match box 3.07 per cent to Rs3/box, washing soap 1.2 per cent to Rs51.5/250gm cake.

"ISLAMABAD: The government has increased local LPG price by 8.05 per cent to 1,530.3/cylinder for Nov 2020, as in the international market price also increased.

In absolute terms, this is an increase of R114.05/11.8kg cylinder from Rs1,1416.29/cylinder in October. The new prices would come into effect from Nov 1 (today). The commercial cylinder price has also been increased by Rs439 to Rs5,888 from Rs5,449/ commercial cylinder.

The LPG prices increased due to a hike in Saudi Aramco Contract Price for the month of Nov 2020. As per record, the CP for Oct 2020 was $379/MT, which increased to $437/MT with the increment of $58.5 per metric ton.

The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) notified the new rates, under which the LPG price has been increased by Rs9.66/kg to Rs129.7/kg from the October price of Rs120/kg.

"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday reserved its decision on power distribution companies’ (Discos) petition seeking permission to charge Rs1.37 per unit extra from consumers for one month.

The regulator held a public hearing on Thursday on the petition of the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). It pleaded that Discos may be allowed to charge Rs1.37/unit more from consumers in their next bills, arguing that the cost of generation was high, while it sold the electricity at lower price to consumers.

Nepra Vice Chairman Saifullah Chatta, who presided over the meeting, questioned why the additional furnace oil worth Rs5 billion was used in September for power generation. National Power Control Centre informed that due to 5 percent less gas supply to power plants, furnace was used. The proposed increase will have an impact of Rs17.40 billion.

Nepra Chairman Tauseef H Farooqi said, “We have to take care of the consumers’ interest too.” He said that they will announce the judgment over the proposed increase within seven days. The petition for tariff increase for September 2020 had been filed by CPPA on behalf of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos). The CPPA in its petition said that it had charged consumers a reference fuel tariff of Rs2.841 per unit in September, while the actual fuel cost turned out to be higher. Hence, it should be allowed to charge Rs1.3697 per unit additional cost from consumers next month.

Energy generation in September 2020 was recorded at 13,103.80GWH. The total cost of energy generated amounted to Rs53.91 billion. The total electricity sold to Discos was 12,722.97GWH for Rs53.56 billion. Transmission losses during September were 2.91 percent.

The hydropower generation contributed the highest share of 37.18 percent or 4,871.96GWH to the overall power generation. Coal-based power plants contributed 17.42 percent or 2,282.85GWH. The cost of the coal-based electricity was Rs6.0262 per unit.

In September, 71.70GWH expensive electricity from high speed diesel was generated at Rs18.7347 per unit. The electricity imported from Iran contributed 0.36 percent or 46.66GWH at a cost of Rs10.1504 per unit. Mixed energy contributed 0.09 percent or 11.90GWH at the cost of Rs 6.4751 per unit.",negative
"ISLAMABAD: The government has increased the gas tariff for CNG, IPPs, captive power plants and general industries, including export-oriented sectors. However, it kept the tariff unchanged for household consumers, commercial sector and roti tandoors. The new prices will be effective from September 1, 2020.

According to a notification by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the gas off-take for the CNG sector has been determined at a flat rate of Rs1,283 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) against the earlier tariff of Rs1,371/mmbtu. While its minimum monthly fixed charges have been increased to Rs 46,229/month which were earlier Rs45,803.1/month.

For independent power producers (IPPs), the bulk off-take tariff has been increased to Rs857/mmbtu from earlier Rs824/mmbtu. The minimum charges have been however reduced to Rs28,898/month from Rs29,416/month.

For captive gas users, the tariff has been increased to Rs 1,087/mmbtu from earlier Rs 1,021/mmbtu. Captive plants are those which have been established by an industrial undertaking/unit to produce power for their own consumption and or sell surplus to DISCOs or bulk power consumers. Captive power plants’ minimum gas charges have been increased to Rs36,653/month from earlier Rs36,450/month.

The minimum charges are those that are levied by the gas utility if you consume gas or not, you will have to pay it. In other words, it is just like meter rent in the electricity bills or line rent of PTCL phone connection. For WAPDA and K-Electric’s power stations, the bulk tariff has been increased from Rs824 to Rs 857/mmbtu and minimum charges havebeen reduced to Rs28,898/month from earlier 29,417/month.

For all established commercial units, the tariff and minimum charges have been kept unchanged at Rs 1283/mmbtu and Rs 6,415/month respectively. The commercial units include those with local authorities or those dealing in consumer items for direct commercial sale like cafes, bakeries, milk shops, tea stalls, canteens, barber shops, laundries, hotels, malls, places of entertainment such as cinemas, clubs, theatres, and private offices, corporate firms, and ice factories.

For tandoors, the minimum monthly charges have been kept unchanged at Rs 148.5/month. The gas tariff for tandoors will also remain unchanged for first two slabs at Rs 110/mmbtu and for next two slabs at Rs 220/mmbtu and for higher slab it will be at Rs 700/unit.

For the general industrial sector that includes all consumers engaged in the processing of industrial raw material into value-added finished products irrespective of the volume of gas consumed, but excluding such industries for which a separate rate has been prescribed, the gas tariff has been increased to Rs 1054/mmbtu from earlier Rs 1021/mmbtu. However, the minimum charges have been nominally reduced to Rs 35,540/month from earlier Rs 36,499.7/month.

The government has kept unchanged the gas tariff and minimum charges unchanged. The price for zero-rated and their captive plants has been increased from Rs 786 to Rs 852 per mmbtu. The gas price for export-oriented (general industry) has been increased and export-oriented (captive) has been increased from Rs 786 to Rs 852 per mmbtu.

The government is currently giving subsidy to zero-rated industry and increase in its price would reduce the burden on the national exchequer. However, the textile industry would protest against it.",negative
"ISLAMABAD: Fuelled by exorbitant increase in food prices, weekly inflationary pressure on economy measured by Sensitive Price Index (SPI) was recorded at 9.2 percent at the week ended on October 15 over the corresponding week of last year, irritating millions of poor and fixed-income Pakistanis.

Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) latest SPI snapshot that gauged weekly price volatility of 53 daily use items (mostly kitchen items) and its data is collected from 17 urban centres, revealing increase in prices of 25 items, decline in nine, and 17 remained unchanged. The SPI during the week under review witnessed an increase of 0.45pc over previous week.

Ironically, cost of living of millions of Pakistani citizens is going up because of skyrocketing inflation, while the ineffective governments (central and provincial governments) administration is without any clear-cut policy and even will, to bring the ‘elephant in room’, independent economists say.

High inflation is mercilessly pushing masses below the poverty line, eating up their purchasing power. In a span of one week, farm chicken price increased by 15.35 percent to Rs199/kg, egg by 5.84pc to Rs168/dozen, tomatoes 3.45 percent to Rs133/kg, LPG 3.24 percent to Rs1,317/11.67kg cylinder, sugar by 2.14 percent to Rs100/kg, rice-IRRI-6 by 0.6 percent to Rs71/kg, fresh milk 0.5 percent to Rs104/kg, wheat flour 0.4 percent to Rs1,049/20kg bag, ghee 0.37 percent to Rs247/kg and basmati price increased by 0.30 percent to Rs91.24/kg over prices of previous week. Some items’ prices declined over previous week. Banana prices declined by 2.5 percent to Rs62/dozen, onions 2.30 percent to Rs73/kg, electricity 1.98 percent to Rs3.96/unit, potato 1.75 percent to Rs69/kg, garlic 1.12pc to Rs228/kg and Moong pulse prices down by 0.64 percent to Rs241/kg.",negative
"ISLAMABAD: The Indus River System Authority (IRSA) on Thursday anticipated that Rabi season (winter crops) would face irrigation water shortage of 10 percent for sowing of major crops including wheat, tobacco, barley, mustard, gram, lentil, potatoes, onions and tomatoes.

In Pakistan, Rabi season starts on October 1 and ends on March 31. The IRSA advisory committee that met here with Engr. Syed Zahid Abbas, Chairman/Member IRSA in chair approved the approved anticipated water availability criteria for the season. It anticipated that the Basin-wide shortage at 10 percent which was less than previous Rabi 2019-20’s forecasted shortage of 15pc and actual shortage of 20pc.

It was agreed by the participants that the likely projected shortages were manageable and hopefully the cropping targets for Rabi 2020-21 would be achieved be applying efficient and best water management practices. Balochistan and KP are exempted from water shortages.

The committee also approved additional allocation of 0.149MAF for Kachhi Canal of Balochistan. However, carry-over storage of 0.5 MAF for Early Kharif 2021 was linked with mid-season-review of the anticipated Rabi Criteria 2020-21 and in case of better inflows carry-over storage provision would be revisited.

It also reviewed the Kharif 2020 (April-Sept) system operation and observed that the actual Rim-Station inflows of 97.80 MAF remained 10pc less than forecasted volume of 108.24MAF. Despite reduction in inflows, the committee expressed satisfaction that the actual provincial withdrawals remained at 65.106 million acre feet (MAF) and provinces got indented supplies.

The actual system losses were 12.374MAF as compared to anticipation of 17.633MAF and downstream Kotri releases remained 14.698MAF. The committee appreciated the efforts of chief engineer Chashma Barrage regarding the flushing of sediments from the reservoir carried out in last Ten-daily of August, 2020. It was expected that this flushing operation would reclaim considerable lost storage volume.

The committee also valued the facilitation of IRSA and the role of Flood Mitigation Committee (FMC) of Mangla Reservoir in mitigating of flood peaks in late August 2020, successfully.

IRSA Advisory Committee discussed the recommendations of IRSA Technical Committee Meeting held on 25.09.2020 and approved likely Anticipated Water Availability of 23.444 MAF at rim stations for Rabi 2020-21.

Based on the Rim station inflows plus storage release of 12.054MAF minus the expected system losses of 2.487MAF and minor involuntary escapage downstream Kotri of 0.044MAF, the approved likely availability at respective provincial canal heads will be 32.968MAF with Punjab have 17.813MAF, Sindh 13.433MAF, KP (CRBC) 0.701MAF and Balochistan 1.022MAF.

Water availability at canal heads of 32.968 MAF was 13pc higher than last year’s availability of 29.20 MAF and 9 pc higher than 10-year’s average of 30.22 MAF.

The committee was apprised that Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) - within the umbrella of Australian Aid and under supervision of IRSA, MoWR, Wapda and focal persons of the provinces - had prepared a software named as Water Apportionment (WAA) Tool, which forecasted rim-station inflows and performed system operation by running the reservoirs on set rules, routing the flows in the river network with accompanying losses/gains, allocating shares to the provinces on different sharing options and releasing excess water downstream Kotri, if available.

The committee was informed that calculations of the tool for Anticipated Criteria Rabi 2020-21 matched exactly with the assessments of IRSA and that the shortage predicted by the tool was also 10 pc.",negative

When I think of the daily circus that is the evening TV political talk show circuit, only a fraction of their airtime is dedicated to issues that have any lasting impact.

Almost none of the issues that received breathless coverage a year ago are of any consequence to the lives of ordinary people in the country today. I see no reason why the 2020 season of political soap opera will be any different.

So, let us look back at the outgoing year and identify key trends and events that are likely to have a lasting impact on Pakistan in the years to come.

Covid-19: This is, hands down, the biggest event to hit Pakistan and the world this year. It induced behavioural changes in a large segment of the population who are now mindful of the spread of viruses by touch and by air and are at least aware of the need to wear a facemask. However, as of September, 46 percent of Gallup survey respondents (most under the age of 30) were of the opinion that the coronavirus is a conspiracy theory or hoax.

So far, the virus has cost us 7,285 deaths (and counting). Unemployment is predicted to surge to 28 percent. Schooling stopped for nearly 50 million students for the bulk of the year. Forty percent of the population is expected to fall under the national poverty line; 45 percent of children are at risk of malnutrition. For the vast majority, dying of hunger due to the lockdown economy has been a bigger worry than dying from Covid. With a resurgence in positivity rate of over six percent, in November, a second lockdown or at least several smart lockdowns are imminent. This is far from over.

Vaccine: According to a recent IPSOS survey, 63 percent of Pakistanis will refuse to get vaccinated when a vaccine becomes available. This attitude is reflective of the reach and damage conspiracy theories have on an undereducated population unable to think critically and distinguish between WhatsApp fiction and reliable fact. While there are now two promising vaccines based on messenger RNA technology (Pfizer and Moderna), the fact that Pakistan has not been an early investor in the development of either of them means that its place in the customer queue is near the end of the line.

It will be quite some time until we can hope to acquire any vaccine in sufficient numbers. Add to that the challenge that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require extreme refrigeration at -94 and -20 degrees Celsius, respectively. This will mean building a dedicated refrigerated supply chain, something we have not seen even being discussed in government circles yet.

NCOC: Covid-19 did not induce any structural changes to speak of, save one: while the central government often sets up some kind of national command center in times crisis, the National Command Operations Center (NCOC) established for dealing with the pandemic distinguishes itself from prior command centers in that its decisions are heavily data driven. This approach has introduced the concept of targeted interventions supported by data in place of broad decrees that blanket a province or the entire country – a scalpel in place of a broadsword. However, this new approach has not extended much further down into the government machinery for other decision-making yet.

WFH: A sliver of professionals and knowledge workers were able to retreat to the protective bubbles of their homes and continued to work-from-home (WFH). However, many smaller businesses and offices were unable to make the quick transition to digital, least of all government. During the peak of the first wave, staff at government offices was reduced to essential staff only. LinkedIn hype aside, for the vast majority of workers, WFH will not become the new normal in the foreseeable future.

Digital Divide and Schools Reopen: The digital divide in the country was also exposed in the unpreparedness of the majority of schools and universities to adopt online education. Again, the sliver of elite private schools and universities, who were already using learning management systems and had students that owned computers and broadband internet connections at home, were able to switch to online education with limited success.

However, for the vast majority of students the shutdowns of educational institutions translated into an early and extended summer vacation. As schools reopened in the last few months, accounts are emerging of the reality behind the government’s claims of online and distance learning during school closings. The learning loss that has resulted from these extended closings will be felt in the years to come. Schools will likely shut down again for an extended winter break. For most students, this academic year will have to be written off as a loss.

Aurat March: Early in the year, the second Aurat March put a spotlight on women’s rights and sparked heated debates. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report for 2020, Pakistan’s rank continues to languish at 151 out of 153 countries, only ahead of Yemen and Iraq.

Hang the Rapist: With this backdrop, the once taboo issue of violence against women is receiving more airtime. Every few weeks a high-profile case of rape or violence makes headlines (Lahore Motorway, Kashmore, etc). Coverage of these cases is causing public outrage and has been increasing the pressure on the government to enact police and legal reforms, but until that happens, with 11 cases of rape and gang-rape reported daily, and many more going unreported, Pakistan remains among the most unsafe countries for women and children.

SNC and Aik Nisab: Historically, changes to the national curriculum have been whisked through without much public scrutiny or questioning. However, in 2020 the Single National Curriculum, or SNC, has ignited public debate like few curriculum changes in the past have, with numerous public intellectuals as well as the general public weighing in.

The increased public interest and input on an issue ordinarily considered insipid and dull has taken aback many in government. This greater-than-expected level of public engagement can be attributed to the rise of online platforms and wider internet penetration that have given voice to the otherwise voiceless.

Tea was Fantastic. The India-China Face-Off: India overplayed its hand in Balakot in 2019. The scrapping of Article 370 changing the status of Indian Occupied Kashmir later that year and the curfew and crackdown transformed it into the world’s biggest open-air prison have further opened India to charges of human right violations that the world is finding difficult to ignore, irrespective of trade interests. In 2020, India overplayed its hand once more when Indian soldiers skirmishes with Chinese forces in the Galwan river valley and several other points at the border.

The Modi government’s aggressive actions and diplomacy, not only against Pakistan, but also China, Nepal and Bangladesh, coupled with human right violations in Indian Occupied Kashmir have set it back on its heels, a rare situation for the Pakistani Foreign Office to find itself in.

Indian Terrorism Exposed: In mid-November, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and DG ISPR Major General Babar Iftikhar held a press conference in which they publicly released evidence of what had long been alleged by Pakistan – Indian financing of anti-Pakistan militants hiding across the border in Afghanistan, using its string of consulates along the border. The evidence included bank transactions and audio clips of Indian handlers and terrorist assets.

This public presentation of facts is a major departure in style and substance for Pakistan. While a single press conference may not change much, sticking to this more open style of argumentation will make it more difficult for world powers to look the other way.",neutral
"As expected, the PTI has emerged as the single largest party in the Gilgit-Baltistan assembly elections. According to unofficial results, the PTI has won 9 seats, but fell short of the simple majority of 13 seats to form government.

This means that the PTI will have to rely on independent candidates to get the required majority. It is expected that the majority of independents will join the PTI to form government. The ruling party will also get the largest share in reserved seats for women and technocrats.

The Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly consists of 24 directly elected seats, in addition to nine reserved seats for women and technocrats that are allocated based on a proportional representation basis. The house has 33 seats in total.

Even though the PTI emerged as the single largest party in the assembly, this victory is not as dominating as the PPP and the PML-N had in 2009 and 2015 respectively. The PPP won 15 seats in 2009, while the PML-N won 16 seats in 2015. Both the parties won with a landslide. But the PTI failed to win the simple majority of 13 seats.

Independent candidates won seven seats, the only surprise in this election. Independents have never won so many seats before. In the previous two elections, the mainstream political parties dominated the elections. This time around, the PPP has won three seats. The party was expecting more seats after a marathon campaign led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari who mobilised PPP workers and supporters across the region. He even went to small towns and large villages in the remotest areas of GB. As a result of this well-organised campaign, the PPP has been able to increase its share of votes from 18 percent in 2015 to 26 percent in 2020. The PTI got 28 percent share of votes in this election. The number of winning seats is less than what the party leadership was expecting. The PPP needs to build strong organisation in GB on the basis of this impressive election campaign.

The PML-N is the real loser in this election and could only manage to win two seats. Both seats were won from Diamer district. The PML-N won 16 seats in the 2015 elections. But nearly half of the PML-N’s GB leadership left the party before the elections and the majority joined the PTI. Some electables contested as independents.

The PML-N is blaming pre-poll rigging and political engineering for this poor show. The question is: what did the PML-N do to strengthen the party in Gilgit-Baltistan in the last five years while it was in power?

Weak party organisation should be a matter of concern for all the parties. In general, political parties focus on party organisation and political work at the grassroots level between two elections. Unfortunately, political parties have replaced party organisation and political workers with electables. Instead of strengthening the local party organisation and structures, they prefer to win over influential and rich candidates in different constituencies to win more seats.

Electables have no political ideology and loyalty so they change political loyalty before every election. Political parties have encouraged this movement of electables from one party to other before elections.

Political parties need to change this strategy, which has caused lot of damage to democracy and political culture. First, the parties rely on electables and when these electables change loyalty, they cry foul.

These electables join a particular political party which is poised to win elections. They do it to remain in power. The parties need to take a principled and clear stance to stop this practice since it has damaged political parties at local levels.

Electables are not the substitutes of party organisation at the local levels. When in power, political parties ignore party organisation and structures and work through their elected MPAs and MNAs. If our political parties are serious about stopping the pre-election rigging and engineering then they should focus on strengthening local party organisation and internal democracy. Instead of nominating party officials upto district level, they should be elected in open, free and transparent internal party elections. The other factor is that people in Gilgit-Baltistan prefer to vote for the ruling party in Islamabad. Gilgit-Baltistan looks towards the federal government for funds and development. PTI ministers promised jobs to unemployed youth as well as economic opportunities in the tourism sector. This factor places the ruling party in the centre at an advantageous position.

There is a desperate need to develop the infrastructure of roads, bridges, schools and hospitals in many parts of Gilgit-Baltistan. Tourism needs basic infrastructure and services to boost this sector. The federal government provides the financial resources for such infrastructure development and services. So every federal government has tried to use this position to win elections in Gilgit-Baltistan.

In 2009, the PPP was in the federal government so it won 15 out of 24 seats. In 2015, the PML-N was in power so it won 16 seats in the GB Assembly. So it is not surprising at all that the PTI will be forming government there.

Both the PPP and the PML-N have alleged that the GB election was not fair and transparent. Both parties have alleged that the ruling party used government resources to lure the voters. The PPP chairman made the announcement in a tweet, stating “My election has been stolen. I will be joining the people of Gilgit-Baltistan in their protest shortly.”

The Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) has released its preliminary report on the Gilgit Baltistan elections 2020 in which it said that the voting and counting processes were according to the law but there were some irregularities. ""Voting and counting processes at the polling stations [were] conducted mostly according to the law and prescribed rules, though the legally mandatory provision of Form 45 (the Result of the Count) to polling agents was reported to have not been fully ensured by the presiding officers,"" said FAFEN in its report.

However, FAFEN pointed out that not all polling stations were able to follow the rules in accordance with the prescribed regulations. ""Observers deployed by FAFEN reported an average of around three illegalities or irregularities per polling station. These included breach of the secrecy of the vote, stamping of ballots by others on behalf of voters, and voters registered at the polling stations turned away for various reasons despite having their National Identity Cards (NICs)"", read FAFEN's report.

"Despite President Trump’s reluctance to concede defeat, in a major departure from a time-honoured tradition, President-elect Joe Biden is busy receiving congratulatory messages from the world capitals. The latest to join the list is China which had extended delayed greetings to him on his electoral victory.


It is now apparent that the world is convinced about the Biden presidency being a mathematical certainty despite President Trump’s all-out efforts to cast doubts on the integrity of the electoral exercise. Predictably, the countries have begun the processes to position themselves on a whole range of issues vis-a-vis a Biden-led White House.

As the president-elect decides on the names of the key aides to work on his team and determines his administration’s domestic and global priorities, it is certain that the new administration would revert to a more systematic, rules-based and traditional approach to foreign policy, which will bring the era of ‘decree-by-tweet’ to a close.

Biden is likely to encourage a greater multi-agency buy-in in the process of formulating the policy choices. At the same time, he would demonstrate a change in approach and communication style in dealing with thorny foreign policy issues.

Biden believes that the ‘America first’ approach employed by the Trump administration as the governing principle has led to an ‘America alone’ outcome in the realm of international relations. He is likely to strengthen alliances and reinforce partnerships in an effort to strengthen the global leadership role for the US. The beginning of an era of multilateralism seems to be on the cards.

Biden may have said during the campaign trail that his administration’s foreign policy approach will be determined by the domestic policies. It remains to be seen how far the new administration can resist the temptation of delaying the crucial reset in its relations with the outside world.

While the Democratic victory has been largely well received in Europe, for it wards off an immediate danger of further rupture in the longstanding Trans-Atlantic partnership, the welcome has been less uniform in the Middle East which presents a formidable test for the Biden administration’s resolve and foreign policy vision.

Renegotiating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), famously known as the Iran nuclear deal, is the first and foremost challenge facing the new administration. Biden has been unrelenting in his criticism of President Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the Iran nuclear treaty, calling it a “dangerous failure”. He is keen to lead a multilateral effort on the Iran issue to assure America’s allies of the US as “a partner whose word can be relied on”.

In an op-ed for CNN posted on its website on September 13 this year, Joe Biden tore Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy into pieces by stating that his reckless handling had allowed Iran to stockpile 10 times more enriched uranium than what it had at the end of the Obama administration’s tenure. Biden announced his administration’s three-pronged approach to Iran. First, while viewing the Islamic Republic as a rival that is challenging the US and its allies in the Middle East, he talked of “an unshakable commitment” to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear capability.

Second, Biden promised to offer Iran “a credible path back to diplomacy” if it demonstrated “strict compliance” with the nuclear deal. Vowing to work with allies, he said he would make sure that the sanctions imposed by the US would not undermine Iran’s ability to fight the corona pandemic, a reference to the imposition of stringent sanctions by the Trump administration at the height of Covid-19. Mind you, Iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the world.

The third plank of Biden’s proposed plan is to “push back against Iran’s destabilizing activities” that threaten the interests of the American allies and friends. It also includes further working with Israel to beef up its defence capability against Iran. The starting point for such a partnership is the US-Israel Security Assistance Agreement, which was signed during his vice presidency.

Renegotiating his way into the Iran nuclear deal could prove to be much tougher than is generally assumed. According to Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, two of America’s closest allies, will put up strong opposition to any such initiative.

Biden’s policy on the Israel-Palestinian issue will not be much different from that of President Trump. He will continue to keep the US embassy in Jerusalem, a highly controversial move undertaken by Trump that attracted global ire including from his European allies. He will also keep supporting Israel’s sovereignty over Golan Heights.

Other than mentioning the ‘two-state solution’ mantra once in a while, the Biden administration would neither initiate nor welcome any policy that promises to grant concessions to Palestinians. After all, he is on record as having rubbished Bernie Sanders’ idea of getting concessions for Palestine as “ridiculous and unacceptable” during the primaries.

President Trump pulled off two significant successes when he presided over new peace deals between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain as part of his Middle East Peace Plan. Biden described the signing of the normalisation agreements as an “historic breakthrough” and vowed to get other countries to ink similar accords.

A major departure of the new administration will be in the form of restoration of funding for the Palestinian Authority and UN Palestine that was cut by Trump as well as the likely opening of the Palestinian Liberation Organization’s mission in Washington and the US consulate in Jerusalem, which is responsible for Palestinian affairs.

Biden’s approach toward Palestine does not represent any departure from earlier policies adopted by different administrations. He does object to Trump’s unilateral ways of dealing with the issue but is okay with the outcome. It is more of the same approach rooted in his belief to do everything possible to provide “ironclad security to Israel”.

After all, support for Israel has enjoyed bipartisan consensus in Washington. No US president has ever dared approach the Israel-Palestine issue in a way that may be deemed as going off the script for the fear of losing support. Biden will be no exception to the rule.

The Biden administration will also be up against the challenge of managing its ties with Saudi Arabia, a key US ally in the Middle East since the 1940s. While Trump established a personal relationship with the kingdom’s leaders and invested in expanding strategic and security relations, a Biden presidency is likely to repeat the standard policy adopted by the Obama administration.

The US-SA relationship lost steam and significantly cooled off during Obama’s period in office, thanks largely to his administration’s conciliatory approach towards Iran, its criticism of alleged human rights abuses and support for the Arab Spring. For Saudi Arabia, that meant the crossing of red lines.

An indication of the return to the Obama-era policies was provided when Biden made a less charitable remark about the kingdom in one of the debates during the primaries. He also criticized Trump for his policy of providing what he termed as a “dangerous blank cheque” to the kingdom and vowed to “order an assessment of our relationship with Saudi Arabia.”

Historically too, Democrats have found democracy, human rights and media freedoms as critical issues determining their view of and a policy toward a certain country. With the likely return of Obama-era foreign policy officials to the State Department, a more traditional approach will inform the new administration’s approach to the Gulf countries.

The Biden administration will be focused on reducing the costs of the US’ involvement in the Middle East without necessarily undermining its influence.",neutral
"PESHAWAR: The legal battle is far from over between Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s two women candidates for a vacant party seat reserved for women from the erstwhile Fata in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.

A bench of the Peshawar High Court on Thursday declared the nomination papers of the top ranked candidate of the ruling PTI, Ayesha Bibi, as valid. Her papers were earlier rejected by an election appellate tribunal.

However, Mehreen Rauf Afridi, who is at serial number 3 in the party’s priority list, has decided to challenge in the Supreme Court of Pakistan the PHC decision to declare Ayesha Bibi eligible for the reserved seat.

Fazal Shah Mohmand, lawyer for Mehreen Rauf Afridi, told The News that he would file an appeal against the PHC decision in Supreme Court once the detailed judgement was released.

A division bench comprising Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim allowed the writ petition of Ayesha Bibi against the order of the election appellate tribunal that the petitioner couldn’t contest election for the seat as she wasn’t a voter in any of the merged tribal districts. The tribunal had accepted an appeal of another PTI candidate, Mehreen Rauf Afridi against Ayesha Bibi.

The appellate tribunal had set aside the order of the relevant returning officer to accept nomination papers of Ayesha Bibi.

Ayesha Bibi has been mentioned at serial number 1 in the PTI’s priority list of candidates for the reserved seats.

On the other hand, the PTI leadership in a bid to stay away from the controversy has remained silent over the legal battle between the two party candidates. The legal battle has now reached the Supreme Court, but the party did not intervene in the matter.

Jahangir Khan Mohmand, the legal counsel for Ayesha Bibi, submitted that the election tribunal had disqualified his client without proper legal justification.

He contended that the returning officer had accepted nomination papers of the petitioner after fulfilling all legal requirements and going through the record.

The lawyer said his client had submitted Form 21 for the registration of vote to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on August 16 ahead of the imposition of the ban on voter registration in ex-Fata on August 19.

He said later the voter certificate was duly issued to the petitioner and during the scrutiny of nomination papers she was declared an eligible voter in the erstwhile Fata.

The lawyer for Mehreen Rauf Afridi submitted that according to the ECP schedule the nomination papers by the candidates had to be filed by August 26.

He added that after the filing of nomination papers, scrutiny by the returning officer took place on August 28.

The lawyer said only those candidates who were registered as voters in the merged tribal districts were eligible to contest for the two seats reserved for women.

He claimed that the petitioner on the date of filing her nomination papers was not a registered voter in any of the tribal districts as she obtained her voter certificate on August 28 when there was already a ban on the registration of new voters.

According to the number of general seats won by political parties in the July 20 provincial assembly polls in the merged tribal districts, two of the four women reserved seats were allocated to the PTI and one each to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Balochistan Awami Party (BAP).

However, as the PTI had earlier given the name of Aneeta Mehsud only and the BAP had not submitted any priority list, two women reserved seats had remained vacant for which fresh election schedule was issued by the ECP.

The ECP has already allocated the two seats to the PTI and BAP and directed the two parties to produce their priority lists of candidates.

Ayesha Bibi from Mohmand district was the top PTI candidate in the list, followed by Wafa Wazir, who is now out of the contest as she failed to file her nomination papers for the election. Mehreen Rauf Afridi was mentioned by the party at number 3.

Wafa Wazir had also filed a writ petition in the PHC seeking direction from the court to accept her nomination papers, which she claimed were received late by the returning officer after the end of the deadline given in the election schedule. However, the PHC dismissed her petition which put her out of the race.",neutral
"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday granted interim bail to all doctors and paramedics who were arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).

A division bench headed by Chief Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth issued the interim bail order. The arrested doctors and paramedics were directed to furnish two sureties worth Rs50,000 each.

However, the court also ordered that in addition to these bail bonds each petitioner shall also furnish bond of good conduct to the effect that they would perform duties during the notified hours and would not instigate other employees to create hurdles in the smooth work,failing which their interim bail granted order shall stand cancelled/recalled.

The court stated that without touching the merits of the case and to see the true picture of the incident, the court referred the case to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for an inquiry.

The court directed the director general FIA to conduct an inquiry into the matter.

The FIA DG was directed to submit the detailed report to the deputy register judicial within 15 days.

The lawyers comprising Abdul Latif Afridi, Shabbir Hussain Gigyani, Fida Gul, Abid Ali Khan, Muhammad Rafiq Mohmand, Daris Khan, and Muhammad Ismail Mohmand appeared for doctors and paramedics in the petitions.

Shumail Ahmad Butt, Advocate General KP, appeared for respondents.

The lawyers requested the court to declare the arrest of the petitioners under MPO illegal and restrain respondents from rearrests in the FIR lodged against them.

There were allegations against the doctors and paramedics that they made violent entry into the LRH with criminal intent to block the main road and paralysed the routine activities in the city and damaged government properties.",neutral
"When it rains it pours. The Nooras are finding this out for themselves. Is their proverbial luck finally running out? What is unfolding is certainly extraordinary, something they have never experienced before – Panama not leaving them, the court hearings again about to begin, the ordeal all set to continue, and as if all this was not enough there comes the Supreme Court order, emanating from no less than My Lord the Chief Justice himself, that the Sharif sugar mills, three of them, shifted to southern Punjab, should stop crushing sugarcane until the principal case is disposed of by the Lahore High Court where, to the Sharifs’ discomfort, it has been remanded for final disposal.

Through the years, and they have been at the game of power and pocket-lining for a long time, the longest in Pakistan’s history, the Sharifs have had their indulgent judges who could be depended upon to return, let’s say, indulgent verdicts. But were they to draw up a list of obliging judges it can be taken as a certainty that Chief Justice Mansoor Ali Shah would not figure in it – to whom the sugar case has been remanded.

A pox on so-called independent judges…you can almost hear hoarse voices muttering.

Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest, said Henry the Second, and his barons went at Thomas Becket, putting their swords into him. Can no one rid us of these troublesome judges? Wouldn’t this be the refrain today? But times have changed and options have dwindled and, pity the circumstances, it is no longer possible to do what the PML-N managed so brilliantly in 1997, storm the Supreme Court and send My Lord the Chief Justice and two of his brothers fleeing.

PML-N ministers, the usual loudmouths, have been reduced to issuing empty threats and enunciating a new doctrine of infallibility, that Nawaz Sharif is prime minister through the power of the vote and only through the ballot box can he be made to leave, a doctrine which if applied in the US would have prevented the Watergate scandal because Nixon would have mounted the unanswerable defence that he was elected by the people…and who was anyone else to impeach him?

This is the season of wonders and wonderful things, straight out of story books, are happening…miraculous tidings from fabulous Qatar and dutiful sons laying everything missing at the altar of their much-loved late father. To every question of their lordships recourse has been made either to the Sindbad of Qatar or to the patriarch now with his Maker, Mian Muhammad Sharif. Of such stuff is filial piety made…and you will have to hand it to them that while these hilarious tactics are being executed no one concerned seems to feel a morsel of shame.

And so infectious is the example being set that even their lawyers, some of the glibbest across the land, are hard put to trot out plausible arguments in defence of the London flats and the offshore accounts. Hearing some of the tales it is all that ordinary mortals can do not to burst out laughing. Their lordships have not the same liberty. Gravity must sit on their countenances whatever the comedy.

His Excellency the President is no fool. Was his a measured statement or did he blurt out the truth inadvertently when he said – and truer words were never spoken – that the Panama leaks were a visitation from the skies? In their long stay at the highest echelons of Pakistani politics the ruling cadre has never experienced anything like this. Over the years charges have been hurled at them with nothing ever sticking – not the Asghar Khan case involving money taken from that holy sanctum, the ISI, for use in the 1990 elections, not even the Model Town massacre, carried out in the very heart of Lahore with nothing coming out of it, at least none to date.

It is as if no human agency but creatures from outer space were responsible for the killings. Anywhere else, say in Syria, this would have provoked an international outcry with our American friends leading the chorus of indignation. The assault, the entire sequence of events leading up to it, is there captured by a hundred TV cameras but it is as if the memory of it has been sucked into a black hole.

Where is the Justice Baqar Najafi report? What has become of it? What lurking fear or premonition prevents its being made public?

So it is not a little strange that having escaped so much the sturdy ships should now be stuck on the rocks of the Panama papers with no stratagem working, and on the minds of a sceptical public no argument leaving much of an impression, whether backed by Qatari flights of fancy or reverential references to the dear departed.

Now out of the blue – from where everything seems to be emerging – comes another thunderbolt. With enough piled up on their plate already the ruling clan could have done without the order regarding their relocated sugar mills. If nothing else it puts the spotlight on their endless business interests, and prompts the question: how much is enough? How much land does a man require? How much money does he need?

Here is the chief minister of Punjab amending a 2006 notification banning the relocation of sugar mills to suit the business interests of his extended family, and pursuant to that amendment three sugar mills are shifted to south Punjab’s cotton-growing belt. This is pretty blatant but since when did such considerations have much of an effect on Pakistan’s ruling families?

One Zardari should have been enough for any Fortress of Islam. Here the Sharifs seem to be outplaying Zardari at his game. The PPP was supposed to be blatant and crude while the Sharifs were said to be cautious and subtle. The PPP’s corruption read like an open book while for the Sharifs it was claimed that they always covered their tracks. The Panama affair has made nonsense of this dialectic. It is now the Sharifs who look clumsy and flat-footed.

And at least, give it to the man, Zardari never made any snivelling excuses. When facing his many ordeals he relied on no Qatari proxies; nor did he shift responsibility on his late father, Hakim Ali Zardari. His smile never left him, even when he spent long years in jail and had to face one hearing after another. Look at these guys…they are constantly wiping their noses.

After his fall from grace and power Musharraf has conducted himself like a man, not spinning too many yarns and seldom uttering a harsh word about those whom he heaped with favours in his days of glory but who were not to be seen in his hour of adversity. But may Allah preserve the present lot as they shift from foot to foot and outdo some of the greatest writers of mystery tales.",neutral
"Oh, that moment of weakness if only it could be forgotten when Isaac called for pen and paper and in his own hand and at considerable length penned down the saga of money-laundering allegedly associated with the house whose top accountant he had been for so many years.

The tell-all tale was spread over 43 pages, no detail spared, everything about how fake bank accounts in international banks were opened in the names of the Qazi family, long known to Dar. Money from mysterious sources then came into these accounts before being transferred to the Hudaybia Paper Mills.          

The Sharifs are a religious family and the choice of this name testifies to their religious zeal. That this did not prevent the things being done under the rubric of this near-sacred name is of course a different matter.

We are more secular than we care to acknowledge, rendering unto Caesar and Mammon what is theirs, and to Allah what is His. Prayers, fasting and other religious obligations we keep for the uses of the Hereafter. For the here and now we tend to be more pragmatic.     

But returning to the confessions, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had to extract no forced signatures from Isaac’s hands. He wrote the entire account himself and put his signature to it. And also, again in his own hand, he asked for leniency. Since he had out-performed any canary in singing, his name was removed from the list of the accused and he was made an approver…in other words, prime witness for the prosecution.   

The money-laundering charge was but one case against the Sharifs. There were several others. But all of them were put on hold when through the intercession of their Saudi benefactors the Sharifs were taken from their prison cells and flown to the Holy Land. When in the twilight of the Musharraf era the so-called National Reconciliation Order was promulgated and Benazir Bhutto returned to Pakistan, followed by Nawaz Sharif’s own return – this too being the result of Saudi pressure – the national landscape changed.

Bhutto’s assassination rocked the Musharraf regime and in the elections which followed his King’s Party, the Q League, fared poorly. The PPP took power at the centre and Nawaz Sharif’s PML-N, with no small help from Asif Ali Zardari, formed the government in Punjab, the nerve-centre of Pakistani politics. The PPP and the PML-N having come close to each other, no one was interested in pursuing the old cases, including the Hudaybia case based on Ishaq Dar’s confession.

Both the Sharifs and Asif Ali Zardari were quick to approach the courts to quash these cases. Dar did the same and his confession was quashed, it being declared as of no ‘evidentiary value’. Because all of this was being played on a friendly wicket, NAB did not go into appeal against this friendly decision.

We can imagine Isaac’s sense of relief. Incarceration under the Musharraf regime was not so much a nightmare as the statement he had given. Now seemingly the nightmare was over, the albatross round the neck of the former approver finally cut loose.

Remember also that Musharraf being a coup-making general, the charges brought by his regime against the Sharifs – quite apart from whether they were true or false – never elicited any great moral outrage on the part of the intelligentsia, the political class or so-called civil society, all of whom were more obsessed with denouncing dictatorship and celebrating the restoration of democracy, these being the flavours of that time. Corruption and accountability constituted a forgotten agenda.    

Zardari was clever but the Sharifs outplayed him, successfully pulling a veil of obfuscation over their own financial exploits and keeping the spotlight on the PPP, an endeavour in which they received powerful assistance from the restored chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, who could only see the mote in the PPP’s eyes, never the glint in the eyes of the PML-N.

Small wonder, the PPP was branded as an irredeemably corrupt enterprise while the Sharifs were seen as exemplars of good governance and champions of development, a perception paying them handsome dividends in the 2013 elections.

True, Gen Raheel Sharif’s ascendancy became a problem for them because no one likes to walk in someone else’s shadow; and the 2014 dharnas came near to toppling their government. But the general in his winter no longer the commanding figure he was and the dharnas a receding memory, this was a time to savour their triumphs and think calmly about the future.

But everything has been upended by that bolt from the blue, the Panama papers and the hearings in the Supreme Court triggered by them. Uncomfortable questions are being asked for which there are no ready answers and demons long thought to have been laid to rest, like the confessions of St Isaac, are once again on the march, leading to fresh nightmares. When Dar’s lawyer said before the Supreme Court that Dar’s statement could not be used against him, it was suggested to him that could it not be used against the prime minister?      

We don’t know what becomes of it or what value is put on it. But the Sharifs have reason to be worried because the money trial leading to their offshore accounts and rich London properties is right there in this statement, backed by evidence in black-and-white: dates, bank accounts, deposits and transfers, etc.       

The defence the PML-N is mounting rests on one word, duress – the contention that Isaac’s confessions were extracted through coercion, the word gunpoint also being used. Significantly, however, no one is saying that what is in the confessional statement, the details of money-laundering, are false. Shouldn’t that be the real burden of the PML-N’s argument?

It should really be a simple matter. The accounts opened in the names of the Qazi family may be fraudulent but the Qazis are real, living people. Why don’t they come up and say that what is being said about them is baseless, with no truth to these charges?

Why go on about duress when what Dar and his defenders should be saying is that the contents of the confessional statement are false – that there never were any Qazi accounts and so the question of mysterious funds being deposited in them simply does not arise?     

If they were to do this nothing would be left in the Panama case except sound and fury. And Dar’s nightmare would be finally over. But saying not a word about content they are giving the entire nation a sob story of extraction under pressure. If they debunk the contents of the confession the duress charge is automatically proved. But if they go on about duress while not touching the substance of the story who is to believe Isaac’s protestations?         

People retract confessions all the time, not only claiming coercion but roundly denying what they are accused of. Here the funny thing is that in a case which could well have a bearing on the country’s future a person indirectly involved is beating about the bush while saying nothing of the charge against him…and by extension, of the damning charge against the Sharifs.",neutral
"It can now be seen on their faces, the concern stemming from the Panama case hearings in the Supreme Court. As the hearings lengthen and probing questions are asked – questions for which some of the best legal brains in the country have found no ready answers – the earlier brashness and cockiness have disappeared.

Committed N-Leaguers still say that Nawaz Sharif would emerge from this ordeal with his electoral support enhanced. Sceptics would put this down more as an expression of faith – what we call emaan – than anything to do with reality. But even when this confidence is sounded it comes laced with apprehension about what the future may have in store for their embattled leader.

The N-League’s animus since Oct 12, 1999, was towards the army, never the judiciary. So it faces a novel situation as it stares into the judicial unknown. The hearings have developed a momentum of their own and their lordships, much to the PML-N’s ill-disguised chagrin, are conducting themselves in an independent manner. Throughout its long history in politics the PML-N has been used to, let’s say, a ‘friendly’ if not openly collaborative judiciary. Facing an independent bench is a new experience for its leaders, and it is showing.

 This is one reason for the shuffling and reshuffling of lawyers. In the past before indulgent benches, lawyers with a long history of association with the Sharifs – Akram Sheikh, Salman Butt, Ashtar Ausaf Ali, the present attorney general who was for long a family lawyer – were considered sufficient to meet the ends of justice or expediency. And before indulgent benches these eagles delivered handsomely. But before a slightly different kind of bench the same lawyers were found to be inadequate…which explains their less-than-glorious retreat from the scene of battle.

Another problem for the ruling clan, and again novel in its dimensions, is that it cannot blame its present predicament on the usual suspects: ISI, the ‘establishment’, or some group within the army. In this whole affair the army has no bias unless the army, importing stealth technology from Boeing or Lockheed, has mastered the art of stealth intervention. This is a matter which has fallen from the skies, manufactured by no shadowy outfit. And the ruling family, much as one may sympathise with it, is finding it difficult to handle this phenomenon.

The 2014 dharnas which came near to toppling the government were blamed, as we can recall, on a section of the army high command, the whole of the ISI and the two supposed cat’s-paws: Imran Khan and Allama Tahirul Qadri. Whom can you blame the Panama Papers for?

But hardcore N-Leaguers still feel there is a conspiracy afoot but unlike the past this conspiracy they place firmly within the party. Some important figures in the party, they feel, instead of coming unabashedly to the aid of the beleaguered family are not only hedging their bets but are actively involved in making things more difficult and complicated for the family.

Why, they ask, are some powerful ministers completely mum about what the ruling family is going through, saying not a word and not coming to its defence? The task of defending the ruling family has fallen on the shoulders of the Young Turks who take their inspiration from the prime minister’s daughter, Maryam Nawaz, the figure seen in many circles as being groomed for the party’s succession. You can see them before the cameras every day, eyes flashing and voices rising.       

One of the Turks, Muhammad Zubair – though not quite qualifying for the adjective ‘young’ – has been rewarded with the governorship of Sindh. The others can be forgiven for wondering when their turn comes for similar recognition.

This was supposed to be a year of steady sailing, mega-projects being unveiled and loadshedding brought down, before victory in the coming elections, which everyone in the N-League takes for granted. It is turning out so differently: the party’s complacency coming apart on the rocks of the Panama hearings…and the end still not in sight.

This is how the unexpected comes about. Gen Musharraf in his wildest nightmares could not have foreseen anything like the lawyers’ movement. On March 8, 2007, he was all joy and triumph, celebrating International Women’s Day in the Presidency, Begum Sehba Musharraf on one side of him, fetching Sumaira Malik – minister, quite appropriately, of women’s development – on the other. And the very next day,         March 9, came about the incident with CJ Iftikhar Chaudhry which ignited the lawyers’ movement.      

Gen Zia after dismissing Junejo thought he had secured his future. Then came the fatal air crash over Bahawalpur which some still trace to an international conspiracy. Bhutto thought he had the 1977 elections all taken care of and then he overplayed his hand giving birth to the fatal PNA movement, which paved the way for Zia’s martial law. Field Marshal Ayub Khan was celebrating his Decade of Development in October 1968 just when the movement against him started, leading to his ouster several months later.

I am not saying that something similar is on the cards. Let us not play Cassandra. But from the N-League’s point of view some of the signs to be seen are ominous: the day-to-day hearings, the nightly dissections of the ruling family’s financial dealings on every TV channel across the media landscape, the probing questions from the bench about financial trails which seem to exist only in the realm of Qatari imagination. Where is all this leading to? No one can tell, the unpredictability of it the most unnerving part.

This atmosphere is leading to unmistakable signs of paranoia, such as the scepticism being voiced about key N-League ministers. Whose game are they playing when they attack the Supreme Court bench hearing the Panama case, as Saad Rafique did recently at a workers’ convention? Whose purpose is served when the interior minister on a regular basis takes on the PPP when the PPP should be the least of the N-League’s concerns?

Nisar Ali Khan played a similar role during the dharnas, adding to Nawaz Sharif’s problems when out of the blue he attacked the PPP’s Aitzaz Ahsan…this at a time when the PPP casting all reservations aside was coming to the N-League’s defence.

According to some claiming to be in the know, in the siege mentality now prevailing in the PM’s house, questions about ministerial loyalty that could not be voiced before are not only heard now but heard attentively. Nawaz Sharif is not an impulsive man and does not come to judgement quickly. But they say that he is missing nothing.

Tailpiece: Just when one might have thought that nothing worse could happen comes news, leaked no doubt, of the gift of a prize horse to the amir of Qatar flown to that magic emirate aboard an official aircraft. Has the PM’s staff taken leave of their senses? Did this caper have to come about at this time? And I was just reading about the letter Andaleeb Abbas of the PTI has written to the PM’s office asking for details about the official expenditure on the PM’s private estate at Jati Umra which has been notified as a ‘camp office’. Verily, when troubles come they come not as single spies but whole battalions.",neutral
"Since when did bricks and mortar, up and down motorways, and a few power stations thrown in, change the fate of nations? What industrial revolution did the South Korean-built Lahore-Islamabad motorway usher in? What industrial zones has it helped create?

Pakistan’s problem is not motorways or orange line trains. If only eradicating moral decay and social backwardness was that simple. Its problem is the rediscovery of national purpose, something only possible if the right hands are on the steering wheel.

Pakistan would not have been possible without Jinnah. The Bolshevik Revolution would not have happened without Lenin. Cuba could not have stood up to the United States without Castro. The regeneration of Pakistani society is impossible without the right leadership – leadership not morally tainted and endowed, if we are lucky, with courage, understanding and vision.

Pakistan can build a hundred motorways. It can have bullet trains, an entire series of them, from the Himalayas to the sea. But if its leaders are more interested in stashing ill-gotten wealth overseas than in attending to the welfare and uplift of the people to whom they owe their elevation and prosperity, the country is going nowhere.

First things first…the national stables have to be cleaned. There is too much muck in them. And the nation is told lies and fed on lies and the funny thing is that stupefied by this avalanche of lies it ends up half-believing them. The rich get richer, the power elites become fatter, some more offshore accounts are opened. Life is good for the privileged classes, indeed couldn’t be better, while the masses, bless them, waiting for their reward from the heavens, stay where they are. No amount of motorways is going to change this equation.

Thus the Panama revelations are a chance, an opportunity to turn things around and make a fresh start. The revelations could have led to nothing. The breakup of Pakistan led to nothing. Did any heads roll because of that? Was there a grand calling of accounts, as should have transpired? The country was broken in two, like a dry stick, but we went on as if nothing had happened. We did not even shed too many tears. No black ram was slaughtered at the altar of any temple to propitiate the displeasure of the powers above. The Panama case too could have been a brief light across the skies before vanishing and leaving not a trace behind.

But it hasn’t happened that way. The case has acquired a life of its own and on each hearing more uncomfortable questions are put to the defendants for which no ready or convincing answers are forthcoming.

We must also bear in mind that the times have changed. If this had been 1998 instead of 2017 and if such a case were being heard, it would have come as no surprise if the drama of storming the Supreme Court was re-enacted. But the ruling party, despite its numbers in parliament, is not as powerful as it then was. It could get away with such a thing then. Anything of the sort is impossible now because a) there is Imran Khan and his party to contend with, something which did not exist then and b) the powers that be, call them the ‘establishment’, would not suffer the like adventurism. After Zarb-e-Azb and the tenure of Gen Raheel Sharif the politicians have suffered a loss of power and confidence.

They may be up to their old tricks on the financial front but in dealing with opponents and a judiciary finding its voice and raising its head their power is not what in happier times it used to be.

We are thus seeing something quite new and unprecedented: the Sharifs in power, the levers of power ostensibly at their beck and command, but having to suffer the grilling attendant upon this case in silence, their fury locked up inside and finding no vent for expression. It is possible to imagine how galling this must be.

In 1998 the Sharifs were successful in sowing dissension amongst the apex judges and we know how this feat was managed. Folklore and legend have it that briefcases were involved. Ah, the power of briefcases…what wonders can they not perform? That remedy, alas, is no longer available. Pakistan has moved on, not perhaps in other respects but at least in this that the crudity and naked use of muscle charactering its old politics, the storming of the Supreme Court being one instance of this, is no longer tenable. Even military intervention has become more sophisticated.

The Sharifs are now trying to storm the Supreme Court with the help of some of Pakistan’s most expensive lawyers but so far nothing seems to be working, the grilling and the uncomfortable questions not abating. Let’s see where this camel comes to rest. But the air is rich with possibilities and this is what makes the Panama revelations and the case arising from them so tantalising.

There is an interesting article by Faisal Siddiqui, a lawyer, in another newspaper. It explains how over the years the Sharifs have been able to use the courts to escape accountability and win their legal battles. And he asks: “But are the Sharifs’ legal games coming to an end in the present era of an independent judiciary, and great public expectations for both the equal application of the law against the rulers and administering not merely formal but substantial legal justice?” This is well put.

I wish I knew the answer to this question but the mere fact that such a question is being asked – especially when we recall that the Sharifs have managed to escape so much: the storming of the Supreme Court, the money for election expenses taken from the ISI in the 1990 elections when Nawaz Sharif became prime minister for the first time, the Model Town massacre, which was the closest Lahore in recent times has come to a massacre, and so much else – makes this one of the most important cases in Pakistan’s history.

Can Pakistan make a fresh start? The nation is being fed a steady diet of myths in the name of the CPEC. If we are to make full use of the possibilities that the CPEC with luck should open up, we will have to reconfigure ourselves as a nation. We can’t remain socially and educationally stunted and we can’t have morally-tainted leaders at the helm and still hope for a miraculous transformation of Pakistan merely on the strength of 46 billion dollars worth of infrastructure, with some projects of questionable utility in this package – such as the Sahiwal coal power plant. Whose harebrained idea was it to site this plant among some of Punjab’s most fertile acres?

There is hope on one side and cynicism on the other, born of our national experience. More than anything to do with the CPEC what wins in this battle, hope or cynicism, will have a deep bearing on Pakistan’s future.      ",neutral
"One of the major fallouts of the 21st century is how the internet, and by extension social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, have created an environment where every single opinion will find some followers, regardless of how absurd or outlandish it may be.


Khan won fair and square: 100 likes and 47 retweets. Khan is a pawn of the establishment: 47 likes and 100 retweets. It snows on Mars, 33 likes and retweets.

The truth, to the human mind, is always relative, to many things. First and foremost, is what one wants to believe – ie our cognitive biases. If we want Nawaz to win, and he does, then that’s what happened – fair and square. If we wanted Nawaz to lose, and he didn’t, well: something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

Regardless, though, of what the press has been saying. Day after day, column after column, there have been reports of wrongdoings, in the lead up to the elections. Muzzling of the press. Detentions. Court cases. ‘It’s all agenda driven’, I was told. ‘They don’t want to see change in Pakistan.’ Well, okay, if you insist.

There have also been the usual lot of obfuscators, especially on TV. ‘Look how the jeep and the crane and the book won nothing!’ Sure. But maybe they weren’t in it to win it, as they say. Maybe, they had just been played to eat up the vote bank of a certain party. Who’s to know?

But here we are, the morning after the night before.

Khan’s speech on the day after the elections is being widely recognised. ‘The man spoke from the heart’ and ‘it wasn’t scripted’ are some of the usual captions one comes across. Yes, the speech made sense. Yes, it seemed extempore. But speeches, which are mere words, don’t run countries. Actions do. And over the course of the journey that has brought Khan to where he is now, he has technically taken positions on wrong sides.

Who in his right mind would oppose the women’s protection against violence bill? Who would oppose taking military action against militants, instead suggesting that they (the militants) be allowed to open up their political office? Who would release funds (to the tune of Rs575 million) to a madressah famous for its graduates, including the former head of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Mohammad Omar? Who would bring into his party’s fold one of the founders of Pakistani jihad, and a co-signatory of Osama bin Laden’s international fatwa in 1998?

Defenders sum up Khan’s positions as ‘political necessity.’ That’s also fair. But in doing so, are they suggesting that when he comes to power, he will take an abrupt U-turn and set the course right? Are they banking on this? Sounds a bit like setting oneself up for disappointment.

Others take a different part. Instead of talking the hard talk, they point fingers elsewhere. ‘But what about the others, they aren’t any different.’ Yes. Absolutely not – especially when it comes to the PML-N. But this isn’t about them, is it? They have their crosses to bear, and our job was to remind them, to take them to task, to pressurise them. And that’s what we did.

Now, it’s Khan’s turn.

The PTI chief spoke about better relations with our immediate neighbors, Kabul and Delhi? Does Khan not realise that these two portions of our foreign policy are mostly not much of a part of the Foreign Ministry’s purview? Have never been. Probably will never be. He spoke of the benefit of trade between Pakistan and India. The word from Delhi is that this trade would primarily be in Pakistan’s favor, just because of the difference in the size of the markets. Will Pakistan ever take advantage of this? Or perhaps it would be better to ask: will we ever be allowed to take advantage of this proximity?

For decades, a significant portion of our meagre resources has been taken up by the anxiety over the ‘existential enemy’ at our borders. These are resources that could have been diverted to health, education and infrastructure. If some kind of working relationship with India was to occur, how would some budgets be defended? Would there be a will to take a pay cut, so to speak?

Internal security is another major problem. Yes, the situation has visibly improved, but as one former head of the FIA and Nacta once told me, it’s not because we have worked on the reasons for terrorism and fanaticism in the country, but because we have ramped up our security. Nacta and NAP are one of the cruelest jokes brought upon the nation. Pakistan is, in all senses of the word, a security state. Will Khan get to the root of terrorism and extremism?

Over the past two government terms, activists, politicians and general citizens have all taken a Nasa-grade microscope to every single action (and inaction), law, budget and whisper that the previous ruling party was responsible for. Will Khan be given the same treatment?

If yes, then it would only be par for the course. After all, your staunchest supporter ought to be your strongest critic too.",neutral
"Sometimes things need to get much worse before they begin to get better. Or, you need to hit rock bottom, after which the only movement left is upwards. We’ve all heard these analogies before, especially with regard to the state of our country. And as things get progressively worse, we wait to hit rock bottom. But it never comes.


It is a master class in irony. We have more electricity, yet there is loadshedding. We have more schools, but circa 23 million children are out of school. We have a democracy, yet a handful of families continue to rule the country and undemocratic forces continue to meddle in the affairs of the state. We have one of the largest armies in the world, yet we have a terrorism problem. You get the idea.

Barring the last election, which saw the PTI emerge as a long-awaited third option for voters, Pakistan’s democratic journey has been in the hands of the PPP and PML-N. And neither of these parties has been able to tackle any of the major problems that the country faces. Yes, it can be argued that these parties need continuity of process to get the job done, and had the military not intervened, maybe things could have been better. But did either of these parties have any blueprints in place or some grand designs on correcting the course of the country? I think we all know the answer to this question.

The problem is that hard decisions and actions that are needed to deal with the country’s pressing issues – such as electricity, health and terrorism – not only create complications in the short run, but also don’t make for good optics in the press. Let’s take the example of electricity. Pakistan’s problem has never been about the generation of electricity. It has always been a matter of its delivery. Our transmission lines are old and decayed. There are massive line losses. Grid stations need to be upgraded to handle the new load and deliver it to its respective areas. There is also the issue of theft or kunda. Yet, we continue to install new power plants, which can create more megawatts and makes for a better headline any day.

Education is no different. Yes, we have more schools in absolute terms. But the fine print is that almost all of these are primary schools. And once a child turns 10 and needs to move to a middle school, there are not enough middle schools on the horizon. If children do make it to middle schools, then the next step is high schools, which are even fewer in number.

We have so many primary schools because they were the easiest to get approved and were, hence, used as a political tool as they came with two government positions. However, setting up middle and high schools requires more due diligence and, therefore, hasn’t featured high on the agenda.

At the same time, there is a dearth of suitable teachers. Primary schools can make do with a generic teacher, teaching four to five subjects (much like a general practitioner at a hospital). But in middle and high schools, you need specialised teachers, especially for math and science.

Until a few years ago, there were no math or science teachers in some districts of the country. At the government level, there was no categorisation of teachers either – something that is needed to understand where the gaps are and how best to fill them. Fortunately, over the past three to four years, there has been a growing understanding of this issue. But there is still a long way to go.

The state of politics is, perhaps, the best example of how Pakistan is just jogging in one place. The Sharifs remain a family unit, albeit mercantile and industrialist in nature. While the Brothers Grimm continue to show a unified front, anarchists are licking their lips to see how the next generation in waiting will bring down the House of Sharif. The bulk of their senior party members are longtime political families, who have had political power for numerous generations. The examples are endless – Ahsan Iqbal, Khawaja Asif, Saad Rafique and Khurram Dastgir Khan, to name a few.

And the PPP is no different. The PTI was supposed to be different. It was hailed as a grassroots party that would take power back from industrialists and feudal lords and put it in the hands of the people. Yet, political expediency reigned supreme and the PTI is now littered with multi-generational politicians who have had their way in Pakistan many times over.

The less said about terrorism, the better. The same can be said about the pressures being exerted on democracy and the shrinking space for critique.

Fixing these issues is not possible in a single term. Maybe not even in two. These are problems, positions and ruts that have been set over decades and it would be naive to expect that they will disappear quickly. What is needed is a Pakistan-first attitude, a willingness to say the hard thing and take hard decisions regardless of the outcome. But has it ever been about Pakistan, anyway? All we see are high-visibility, low-impact projects that make better headlines – party first, the rest can go to hell.",neutral
"At a time when governments and dictators alike are clamping down on freedom of speech and expression in print and on television, social media is seen by many as the last frontier where these universal human rights can be implemented.

Even there, states are trying their best to take control of spiralling conversations. But it is the beauty of the medium that makes their job terribly difficult. Issues and conversations move across platforms in the blink of an eye. Screenshots ensure that deleted posts live on. There is nowhere to hide.

This inability to control the conversation has pushed the people in power to take the next dark step: to launch counter-attacks, both in the virtual and physical worlds. There are numerous instances of people being threatened with violence, rape and even death for something they’ve said or posted online. A few months ago, five bloggers ‘disappeared’ for a considerable amount of time after they had posted what was construed by some as anti-national propaganda. One of the five bloggers still hasn’t been found.

Religious minorities and members of the LGBT community are no better. They are routinely ridiculed and harassed on the pretext of being different and not adhering to what is considered to be this country’s perceived identity. But these are macro matters.

On the individual level, the sheer speed at which issues can be made out of nothing online is astounding. All it takes is a well-written bait in the form of a headline or a blurb. And suddenly, the retweets and the shares begin.  What does the spiralling indicate? Does it mean that people actually believe in the content or is there something else?

A recently conducted study states that 59 percent of all links shared on social media aren’t actually clicked at all. This suggests that the share is not based on an actual consumption of or belief in what the post was about.

Why this happens is most interesting. According to the study, there are two key factors at play. The first is low attention span: people read a headline or a blurb and base their decision on that only, without diving into details. The second is sheer effort: it’s just easier to share than to read.

I’d like to add a sub-reason to the first one: a viewer is more likely to share something on social media if it strongly agrees with some preconceived notions they have. In psychology, this is known as a confirmation bias, which is described as the tendency to search for, interpret, favour and recall information in a way that confirms one’s pre-existing beliefs of hypotheses.

So, if a post is, for example, about a politician’s latest corruption scandal and the viewer already believes that most politicians are indeed corrupt, there’s a strong likelihood that he or she will share it online.

There are other biases at play as well. One is motivated reasoning: that we are ‘motivated’ to believe whatever confirms our opinion. The other is naive realism, whereby we believe that our perception of reality is the only accurate view.

It’s like when you see an accident between a car and a motorcycle. The immediate feeling is that it was probably the car driver’s fault. But you didn’t see the accident happen. So why is there a rush to blame? All these cognitive biases are working in tandem to make you think that way.

The rise of social media, fake news and an audience ready to lap up a David vs Goliath story have created a dangerous scenario that people are using to further their own agenda or damage reputations.

Without going into details, a recent case emerged in Lahore where a person made serious and unsubstantiated allegations against another person. What happened next was staggering. The video was posted on a popular Facebook page, with over 400,000 followers. People started tagging others and it started to spiral out of control. At the same time, internet trolls took out personal pictures of the person in question, including those of his wife and children, and started making derogatory remarks.

It has just emerged that the owner of that particular Facebook page had a long-standing issue with the employer of the accused person and has, in all probability, used the accuser as a pawn in his own game. This is an old play that turns Machiavelli on his head. It is routinely seen on social media, especially when religious groups use people to attack minorities. 

The person in question is now taking legal action against both the accuser and the Facebook page that was used against him. But the damage is done. The thousands of people who have shared the article or commented on it have already found the person guilty of the crime that he has been accused of. The social media trial has been completed without giving him the chance to defend himself. And the only reason it has happened in the way it has is because the picture was framed in a specific way to ensure that our cognitive biases got the better of us.

With social media operating like a black hole, is there any light at the end?  How do we overcome these biases? Do fact-based counter arguments work? In the above case it did. But it was one in a thousand. A majority of the people took the conversation to such a debased level by hurling abuses at the person and his family that it seemed as though the best way forward was to hunker down and rely on the speed with which issues are forgotten on social media.

Unfortunately, as things stand today, this is the best strategy until people begin to realise that they themselves are being used as pawns on someone else’s chessboard.",neutral
"Pick a card - any card. That’s how the magician starts. And it’s all downhill from there. The die is cast, and with equal measures of sleight of hand and a fixed deck, the magician bamboozles his audience.
This piece isn’t about magic.
But in today’s Pakistan, there are an infinite number of stories and topics one can talk about and analyse. So, pick a topic – any topic.
How about the latest dropping by Zacarias Moussaoui, the man described as the 20th hijacker in the 9/11 terror attacks? Moussaoui alleges that some high-ups within the Saudi royal family supported Al-Qaeda. Although the 9/11 commission report released in 2004 concluded that there was no evidence of the Saudi government funding Al-Qaeda, all of the attackers were Saudi nationals.
But all that has happened post-9/11 has very conveniently bypassed the Saudis. Talk about putting business before everything else.
Or how about the two students who were arrested in Karachi recently for writing a threatening letter to a coaching centre using the name of the banned People’s Aman Committee just to get a day off? Pakistani parents are reeling in the aftermath of the Peshawar School attack and to find that juveniles are using that, and the threat of violence, just to get some kicks is not only disturbing, but such false alarms can also further stretch an already stretched thin security apparatus.
These kids need to be punished; even the Pope says it’s alright, as long as the kids get to keep their dignity intact. Add to this, the numerous text messages and emails going around about terror threats across in every park, school, bank and washroom across the country, sent – of course – by somebody’s cousin’s uncle’s neighbour who works for the ISI. We always knew gossiping was rampant, but it seems so is rumour-mongering.
How about the one and a half year old girl who was raped and then strangled to death in Karachi? Will the culprit ever be found? What kind of a


sentence will be handed down? After all, we are a nation that acquits gang rapists, not hangs them. And then there’s Shoaib, the 17-year-old who raped and murdered a six-year-old child in Lahore recently. Fortunately, he’s dead, shot whilst attempting to escape police custody.
This piece isn’t about rape either.
For the past few weeks, I have been trying to dissect the National Action Programme (NAP). We have deconstructed the madressahs, the shadow economy that operates in the country, and our consistent use of non-state actors as a state tool. Is there any mention of abettors and sympathisers of terrorists? Perhaps. I didn’t see anything in the version that came to me. But naturally, the government must be aware that to successfully counter terrorism and extremism in the country, it will need to clamp down on both the sympathisers and the abettors. Hold on to this thought.
Let me take you back to a recent court hearing for Mumtaz Qadri, the garlanded and adored murderer of Salmaan Taseer.
As reported in the newspaper, a senior office bearer of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) bar association said that ‘the prosecutor in this case will get a US visa for sure especially if he succeeds in getting Qadri’s appeal dismissed...it will become difficult for the prosecutor to live in the country after this case’.
Another lawyer is on record saying that ‘He (Qadri) is approaching the court for the legal route. Otherwise look what happened in Bannu. People broke into the jail to free the inmates’.
Does this need to be dissected? Sure doesn’t look like threats to me. And incitement to violence. And perhaps jail breaking as well.
These are people within our judiciary. These are the ones who will perhaps be tasked with trying terrorists, hatemongers and the like. Is there anything left to say?
Apparently there is. One of the lawyers for Mumtaz Qadri is also on record hailing the Charlie Hedbo attackers as heroes. But so is ANP MNA Haji Ghulam Ahmed Bilour. He’s even offered a bounty for the owner of Charlie Hedbo. Presumably, he doesn’t want to dine with him.
Pakistan’s biggest problem apparently is terrorism. But terrorism is only the manifestation of a much greater ill. Extremism is described as: ‘beliefs, attitudes, feelings, actions and strategies of a character far removed from the ordinary’. And terrorism is the manifestation of this. But in Pakistan extremism is the ordinary. Look around you; that’s who we are. In our thoughts and actions, in our arguments, debates and beliefs, we take improbable, un-defendable positions and refuse to budge. That is Pakistan today.
How do you get into the minds of a 200 million strong society and work on this? Is it even possible? How long will it take?
I could very easily say: sorry, but that’s impossible. And in my heart of hearts I do believe that it is, under the current circumstances, impossible. But then that wouldn’t be fair. There has to be some light at the end of the tunnel.
There is. In fact there are two headlights – of a bullet train, which is shortly going to hurl into our collective existence.",neutral
"Amidst all the grief in the aftermath of the horrific attack at the Army Public School in Peshawar, there has been one question on everybody’s lips: When is Fazlullah going to be killed?
And each time the COAS or the DG ISI have made a trip to Kabul, the rumour mills have been busily spinning their yarn: He’s gone to share details on Fazlullah’s whereabouts; it’s only a matter of time now; he’s told the Afghans: you take care of him or we’ll have to come in and do it ourselves.
But Fazlullah’s still alive and probably plotting another horrific crime. Yes, one of the visits of the top brass revolved around sharing incriminating evidence, but all we have so far is that the planners of the attacks have been apprehended.
Obviously, this is not enough.
Do we not have the capability of taking this one person out? Do we not have any actionable intelligence? The answer to both questions is: yes, we do. But it would be naive to assume that just because we have the intel and the capability, there are no other obstacles in the way. After all, this is spooky statecraft.
We live in a Machiavellian world – the truth is mostly impossible to unearth, hidden by layers upon layers of lies and deceit. It is correct that evidence on the whereabouts of enemy number one was shared with officials across the border. But what happened next?
Sources privy to the interactions in Kabul suggest that a dossier was thrown our way as well – a dossier spilling over with evidence of violence in Afghanistan planned and operated within our borders. We were adamant – for something, anything. And shortly after the spate of visits, the Afghans launched an operation in the eastern province of Kunar where, intel suggests, Fazlullah was holed up. And soon enough, five people were arrested for involvement in the horrific Peshawar attack.
The truth is that, while an operation has indeed been launched in Kunar, the government in Kabul does not exert much control or


influence in the outwardly provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, Paktika and the like. And if one is to believe what one is hearing, Fazlullah and his cronies roam between these provinces with ease and freedom. However, as we Pakistanis know very well, where this is an absence of control and governance, the only institutions that can operate are intelligence agencies. And not only your own. Take for example, the vast network of CIA operatives that continue to roam across Pakistan, and using their fixers in the tribal regions, plant little blue homing chips on future drone strike targets. That’s how it goes.
In the same vein, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), the Afghan equivalent of the ISI, operates in these restive and far-flung regions. And let me take you back to the episode of one Latif Mehsud. This fellow was nabbed by US Special Forces as he made his way to a meeting with the NDS. And while the Afghans described Mehsud as an ‘insurgent peace emissary’, as reported by the New York Times,” according to Afghan officials, the ultimate plan was to take revenge on the Pakistani military”.
Another reason to accept that the Afghans perhaps don’t have too much control is that we also approached both the United States and the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) for help in getting Fazlullah.
While this is most disturbing, one cannot be surprised by such behaviour – like I said, this is spooky statecraft. But all this went down during former president Karzai’s tenure, and we are all well-versed in his dislike for Pakistan. It is pertinent to mention here that for the longest time Pakistan has held a senior Afghan Taliban member by the name of Abdul Ghani Baradar, a man long sought by the Karzai government to add a much needed impetus into peace negotiations with the Taliban.
Now President Ghani is in charge, and the real questions to ask are: is the Afghan president’s fresh start with Pakistan something unanimous or just something that he alone desires; and b) What kind of control does the government in Kabul have on the NDS?
The NDS and, by association, the Afghan government have long sought the ability to have some kind of negotiating leverage against Pakistan. The attempt to collude with Latif Mehsud is a prime example, and now, Mullah Fazlullah.
This is not acceptable. The Afghan president must rein in his intelligence agency, which it seems increasingly likely is allowing refuge to Fazlullah. Or, really, why can’t we do it ourselves?
Another aspect of spooky statecraft: Cross-border assassinations are part and parcel of how intelligence agencies take care of business. The CIA and Mossad are some of the best exponents of this part. Perhaps it’s time we start dabbling in this dark art ourselves.
Postscript: One usually does not believe in rumours, but sometimes they tend to make sense. Under the overused Machiavellian rule of the enemy’s enemy is your friend, reports suggest that one foreign intelligence agency is also playing its part in protecting Fazlullah.",neutral
"The madrassas, or religious seminaries, have become a sticking point in the implementation of the national action plan (NAP). Religious parties, led by JUI-F, first opposed the 21st amendment over the use of words like “religion” and “sect” in the draft, but later extended the united front to oppose military courts as well.
But their strong opposition to government plans of streamlining madrassas – of which approximately 20,000 are said to be littered over Pakistan – is more likely to prompt a confrontation than other issues.
The government, of course, was aware that the religious right would never allow an investigation into the seminaries, and their complicated system of funding and patronage. That is why it was expected to have worked out an actionable work plan, especially after Zarb-e-Azb and the renewed resolve after Peshawar. Yet there is no progress to speak of, and Islamabad has not shared its plans with the public.
“Everything we think we know about the madaaris and their relationship with extremism and militancy is a perception, not based on any solid research,” said Tariq Parvez, former DG, FIA and Nacta.
“The state is unwilling to conduct any such analysis; afraid of what it might find, but without knowing exactly what and where the problem is, how can we move to correct it?” And it is not just checking teacher-student records that is needed. “We have come across repeated cases where madrassas are not directly involved in raising militants, but they are infiltrated by members of outlawed groups posing as teacher, etc, who then scout for perspective members,” he added. Once appropriate students are short-listed, apparently, they are routed to special short summer courses, where the actual radicalisation takes place. So, even seminaries that are clean have been used as conduits for terrorist activity. Many governments have tried to regulate the seminaries, but efforts have always been met with stiff resistance. This


time, with the government and military openly announcing that all militants were fair game, it was expected that special focus would also be paid on the madrassas that produce them. But initial expectations are now giving way to disappointment. “I don’t see this playing out, we’ve heard it so many times before, but nothing has come of it, there will be a lot of noise, but that’s about it,” said Ahmad Rashid, internationally acclaimed author and an authority on militancy. “It won’t be any different this time.”
Follow the money
The only progress of note was made during the early Musharraf years, but it related more to upgrading syllabi than investigating their operations or powers pulling their strings.
“It wasn’t a complete failure, we made some progress on the inclusion of secular subjects and the registration of students, both local and foreign, but once elected government came into power, the focus shifted,” said Lt-Gen Moinuddin Haider, interior minister from 1999 to 2002.
Haider was tasked with spearheading the reforms project. Religio-political parties were initially hesitant, of course, but he hit a brick wall when the matter of difference between teachings of sects came up, and the hate some inculcate for others. “We never got any solid answers as to where the money to run these schools was coming from,” he added. Since many madrassa students have gone on to openly engage in militancy, it was natural to trace their funding, which is where the process becomes complicated, especially since names of friends kept coming up. “There was money coming in from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait and Qatar, all going to various seminaries, for example, in the guise of building a mosque or opening an orphanage,” the general added. “Probably, there was no monitoring as to how these funds were eventually used.”
And, of course, it doesn’t help that over years a complex web of funding has been put in place. The country has a large shadow economy, and the madrassas are just a part of it. “They don’t operate through banks, but through cash couriers, remittances, religious charity drives and of course foreign funding as well, and for any comprehensive effort to curb extremism and terrorism, this needs to be shut down,” Rashid weighed in.
So far, tracking the funding has gone nowhere. The Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is one of the organisations mandated with investigating terrorism funding, but it has been ineffectual. None of its findings have ever led to a conviction and it can take them years to investigate one case.
Intelligence vs evidence
Since there has never been a thorough investigation into seminaries, there is no official record of what the government might want to take action on. Recently, Maulana Fazlur Rahman complained very loudly against government raids to collect information about teachers and students at madrassas. Therefore, the only knowledge that the government has is based on intelligence reports, not audits or research.
“Actionable intelligence, unfortunately, does not translate into actionable evidence,” said Parvez. Another important aspect is that many of these schools are affiliated with legitimate charities, which have done immense work across the country. Charities like the Jamaat ud Dawa, whose alleged militant wing Lashkar e Taiba has been accused of the Mumbai terror attacks, make the situation very dangerous. “If the state moves against groups which have, for all intents and purposes, never attacked it, the blowback will be immense,” said Gen Haider. Also, the problem about credible evidence remains, and there is also the question of the military being stretched thin because of the NW operation.
Experts like Tariq Parvez suggest profiling ex-madrassa students currently in jails. If certain trends recur, enough evidence can be built against them. But the question of state will still remains unanswered. Just last week a lal masjid student was involved in a suicide attack in Wah, yet no action has been taken against the seminary, nor its chief cleric arrested, despite an outstanding warrant against him.
“Nothing can happen under the current Nawaz Sharif government, because they depend on some kind of tacit support from groups like the Jamiat-e-Ullema-e-Islam (JUI) and the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI),” Ahmad noted.",neutral
"The recently unveiled National Action Plan (NAP) against terrorism is an important document. Important, because for the first time the government has created a comprehensive document detailing exactly what needs to be done if we want to fight back against terrorism.
In fact, the document is so crucial that it needs to put under the microscope; each component needs to be questioned and critiqued and it’s historical trends checked so that we clearly know where we are headed.
This week, let’s talk about madressahs and their funding.
1. Registration and regulation of religious schools. There are over 20,000 religious schools (madressahs), in Pakistan. It has long been alleged that up to ten percent of these schools play a leading role in promoting militancy and extremism. History suggests this allegation is true. The obscure leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar, studied at the Darul Uloom Haqqania, located in Akora Khattak. Others have, let’s just say, graduated with distinctions, from places like the Ganj madressah in Peshawar, the Jamia Binoria in Karachi etc.
However, successive governments have tried, and ultimately failed, in reining in these schools and bringing them into the fold of the National Education Board. The first attempt was during General Pervez Musharraf’s tenure, but the lack of a mutually acceptable middle ground for all the various sects, coupled with major hesitation on the matter of sharing details of students and sources of funding, and of course, strong-arming by the religio-political parties ensured that the attempt was unsuccessful. The next government, led by Asif Ali Zardari also tried, and subsequently failed.
Today, the same parties that stonewalled the earlier two efforts to rein in the madressahs have banded together again, and are threatening the already battered government with massive street agitation if the reforms are initiated. It is also important to note that the current PML-N government


is also closely wedded to these right-wing parties, and expecting any kind of action against these religious schools under their watch, is naive at best.
2. Choking financing for terrorists and terrorist organisations. Over time, militant organisations have created intricate methods of collecting funds through religious charity organisations which operate across the country. This claim is corroborated in a diplomatic cable released by Wiki-leaks, stating that “Pakistan’s extensive network of charities, NGOs and madressahs...readily provides extremist organisations with recruits, funding and infrastructure for planning new attacks”.
While the state has banned numerous such charity organisations, their ability to continue operations under a new name and banner is a major roadblock in the state’s ability to shut down these financing routes. Only this week, the government has frozen the bank accounts of the Jamaatud Dawa, which as its head Hafiz Saeed has rightly deciphered, has only been done under US pressure to appease India. More importantly though, a new name is already making the rounds.
Back to the money trail. The financing of these religious charities is not done through banks or anything like that, but run on suitcases, cash carriers, charity drives as the like. It is part of a parallel, undocumented economy which exists in Pakistan.
The cash transfer method, known locally as hundi or hawala, is a method of transferring cash from one party to another based on an honour system. At its best, it requires zero or minimal identification and background information, hence leaving no paper trail. In most cases, it is faster than most bank transfers, and without the need of bank accounts.
Since it operates on the grassroots level, hundi is next to impossible to control, and as such remains a gray area. Sure, action has been taken, but in the context of the amounts going through, or in relation to the number of transactions flagged, it is a pittance. As someone told me, you plug one hole and they dig another.
The rampant narcotics trade in Pakistan and Afghanistan complicates things further. According to a report released by the National Bureau of Asian Research, Pakistan continues to be a major transit route for most of the narcotics farmed in Afghanistan, and as such, both Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban utilise funds gained through this trade for their own version of narco-jihad.
Did I mention that our long transit trucking network is one of the major players in this flow of money?
Lastly, Saudi Arabia has also been highlighted as a major source of funding, not only for terrorist organisations, but also extremist religious schools. In yet another Wiki-leak released diplomatic cable, then US secretary of state Hillary Clinton is on record saying, “Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide’”. On the other hand, the Kingdom continues to provide billions of dollars to shore up Pakistan’s ever ailing economy. Can Pakistan somehow restructure its relationship with the kingdom? How long will that take?
Terrorism is best countered with a hammer and anvil approach: the former being delivered by your armed forces, but the anvil rather than attacking the end product, strikes against the manufacturing chain, which in this particular case includes both the madressahs and their funds. The hammer alone cannot achieve anything permanent.
I’m not saying it can’t be done. But for the state to think that they can satisfy us – the public, the direct affectees of terrorism – by just a single line or a paragraph, surely it is an insult to our intelligence. So what’s the plan, boys?
None? Didn’t think so.
Our armed forces are stretched thin. And the government has relationships with religio-political parties and certain militant wings as well. How do we fight a fair fight under these circumstances?",neutral
"December 16, 2014 will be a day remembered for long. Not only because 140 innocent children lost their lives in a war that simply has nothing to do with them, but also because that was the day Pakistan irrevocably changed. To put it plainly, December 16 was the day terror entered the lives of every single mother and father in the country.
Can anyone recall the number of terrorist attacks Pakistan has endured? Any guess on the number of people killed or injured? How about families affected? It’s all so hazy now, because it’s been going on for so long, and somehow we’ve managed to sort of pick up the pieces and keep drudging along. But this was different.
And it’s actually rather simple. Before, we just couldn’t relate, unless of course we were directly affected. But if we hadn’t lost a loved one, or been injured ourselves, or at the very least known someone affected by terrorism in our social circle, it didn’t really pinch us. Moon Market, Marriott, Qissa Khawani – they were all the same.
But APS affected everyone. Because we all have children. Because we were all children once. And now when we look at our own, the thought that it could have been them comes piercing through and we shudder in the thought, hug them tight and selfishly thank God it wasn’t them.
And now that the schools have finally reopened, it’s the 16th of December all over again. But something has changed. Schools don’t look like schools anymore. Barbed wires, high walls, guards and snipers are the order of the day. Rumours of security breaches, traced calls to Fazlullah, coffins thrown into schools, and utterly irresponsible journalism by a few have further compounded the confusion and fear; and parents are reluctant to send their kids to school.
When the schools reopened, should the media have been taking the government to task about the measures it has taken to secure our schools and kids, or done what it did instead: praising our brave children? These


children aren’t brave; they’re too young to be brave: they don’t know that they’re in the crosshairs (except the ones at APS) and why should they?
While the reasons for the low attendance can be easily explained and understood, the terror that resides therein is frightening. Most parents are choosing to wait it out, see how things settle, and then send their children back. There is also that horrible fear, that what if I send my child to school today and he or she doesn’t come back, how do you live with that? How does one balance the need for our children to go back to school with this fear that continues to grow with each passing day?
Or do you bite the bullet, kiss your child goodbye in the morning and pray to God that he or she returns home, safe and sound, today, tomorrow and for the rest of his/her life?
If you’re a parent, then you know what I’m talking about – in both cases, whether you send your children to school or not, it’s a lose-lose situation. But as someone said to me the other day, we’ll come to terms with this too. Like everything else. Until something worse happens. And so on and so forth.
What a miserable existence, if there ever was one.
December 16. Remember the date. It’s when everything changed. The question though is simple: where do we go now but nowhere?
The danger is real, the threat within and without. But it’s always been there. All the bombings that have happened; it could have been us, it could have been our children, and its getting closer and closer. Sooner rather than later, every single family in Pakistan will have become a direct affectee in a conflict that has entirely been made in Pakistan. That is what the future holds.
But no, wait, what about the hangings, and the National Action Programme (NAP) against terrorism, Operation Zarb-e-Azb – surely that amounts to something?
Absolutely. It all adds up to zero.
If you look closely at the NAP, a few of the goals mentioned speak volumes of how this is all grandstanding and nothing else. For example: the registration and regulation of madressahs, choking finances of terrorists and terrorist organisations, taking effective steps against religious persecution, ensuring against the re-emergence of proscribed organisations, dealing firmly with sectarian terrorists, and the most humorous: zero tolerance for militancy in Punjab.
Six major points in our comprehensive action plan against terrorism are non-starters. And while we will dissect this farce of a document in a later piece, let me call a spade a spade, or rather what we are being made by the government and to some extent the khakis: complete idiots.
I digress. The point of this piece was to highlight the tragic irony Pakistan faces today, and the fear that has finally found a home. Do I have any recommendations on the way forward? Of course. But anybody who knows anything about the workings of the state and its institutions knows better.
The only way then, it seems, is for us to accept, adapt, and carry on.
Unfortunately, this time, that’s not going to happen. It’s still the 16th of December.",neutral
"Everyone interested in education knows Macaulay and his ‘Minute on Education’, the basis of the English Education Act of 1835, that determined to give the native population of India “a knowledge of English literature and science through the medium of the English language” because no one “could deny that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.”

Virtually no one knows the views of the philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill who, for almost half his life, was associated with the East India Company. In 1836, he submitted a report titled ‘Recent Changes in Native Education’, which was approved by the Company’s Court of Directors but dismissed by the president of the Board of Control. His comments, locked away for more than 100 years, expressed his belief that it was impossible “to expect that the main portion of the mental cultivation of a people can ever take place through the medium of a foreign language”?

All the issues that engage us at this moment are there in this debate from almost 200 years ago – the desideratum of scientific knowledge, the non-availability of content in local languages, the best medium of instruction, and the process of mental cultivation.

Reading history is so humbling. Everything being said today can be found in the columns of the newspapers of those days, ‘The Tribune’ and ‘The Civil and Military Gazette’ from Lahore among them, debating heatedly the pros and cons of the Anglicist and Orientalist positions.

Reading history is also so very sobering. Then, as now, when all is said and done, when all the words and wisdom have been exhausted, it is power that carries the day. What is decided on high is impervious to reason, argument, or the well-being of the recipients – and driven solely by the needs of the ruling class.

There are many fascinating dimensions to this bit of history. Compare Macaulay and Mill to begin with. Were it not for the ‘Minute’, Macaulay would be a footnote to history. Mill, on the other hand, was the most influential English philosopher of the nineteenth century whose ‘On Liberty’ is still considered a seminal text. But the ridiculous pronouncements of the former trumped the commonsense observation of the latter just as the footnotes of today override experts of the stature of Dr Tariq Rehman.

Why commonsense? Because it takes half a minute of honest reflection to recognize its truth. Imagine a five-year-old child from a village trying to understand addition in her own language or in English. Which alternative would she find easier? Imagine her narrating the day’s events in either language. In which would she be able to express herself with greater ease, fluency, and creativity?

The answers are obvious. Why then would we want the child to learn in English rather than in her own language? Is it because content is not available in her language? But what content does a five-year-old child need to learn to add? Give her a pile of stones, a bunch of marbles, a few apples and she would do a lot better than reading out of a book. What content does she need to tell a story or talk about a butterfly or a frog or about the weather and when it is time to milk the cow? And why one milks the cow in the first place and what happens to the milk after it is collected? Making five-year olds learn out of books is a poor and unimaginative choice.

What is given up when a child is taught in a language not her own? “Mental cultivation”, as Mill had mentioned nearly 200 years ago. Instead of learning about things and ideas, the child is left struggling with an alien language, fearful of making mistakes, preferring silence to being laughed at, apprehensive of being tested on things that are not fully understood. This is the beginning of the road to memorization, to reproduction without understanding, to acquiescence instead of enquiry.

If all of the above is so obvious, why is it that parents want their children educated in English, the argument always cited, then and now, in support of English as the language of instruction? In preparing the ‘Minute’, Macaulay had said that “English is better worth knowing than Sanscrit (sic) or Arabic,” and that “the natives are desirous to be taught English.”

The simple answer is easily deduced by a student of the history of education in colonial India: “By making English a necessary skill to gain access to employment in the higher levels of the Indian administration, an English education became something to which all Indians strove.”

The answer to the puzzle is obvious and lies buried in the distinction between the two functions of education – that of mental cultivation or learning and that of a passport to employment. Parents, especially those who are poor and without old-age security, invest in their children in the hope that the latter find good jobs in the market. To that end, they are willing to sacrifice mental cultivation especially when no educationist has made them aware of how high the cost is of the sacrifice.

The English had an obvious vested interest in creating a class of people who, English in all but name, would prove to be “loyal servants of the colonial regime.” But no such interest is at play in a sovereign nation where power is supposed to reside in the people. Why then do we retain English as the passport to good employment requiring such a huge sacrifice in mental cultivation of which all serious educationists have long been aware since the time of Mill?

This is the real puzzle that requires an answer. Why don’t we just do away with the requirement of such a colonial legacy? China does not require it; Turkey does not require it; and they are considered successful countries doing far better than us. For all our English-speaking geniuses we can’t even collect our own garbage, for which we need assistance from the non-English speaking Chinese and Turks.

So why do we continue to require English as the passport for decent jobs? Is it because colonialism has never really left our land? Is it because our neo-colonial masters wish to cripple the mental abilities of the people to keep them loyal, docile, and uncompetitive? Is it because power is afraid of knowledge? Meanwhile, just as in colonial times, there are Chief’s Colleges, quite distinct from the intellectually impoverished institutions for the natives, to reproduce and perpetuate the status quo.

Surely, it should not be so in an Islamic country aspiring to the Riasat of Medina.

"Almost every account of colonialism describes how the colonists planned to use education as a means of stabilizing and strengthening their rule. There was one system of education for those who were to rule and their abettors and quite another for those who were to be ruled.

This narrative, undisputed in the colonies, is not extended to the postcolonial era where the aim of native elites remains unchanged – to use education as a means of stabilizing and strengthening their rule. In Pakistan, the grossly inept, iniquitous, and corrupt monopoly on power can only be sustained on the back of an unquestioning, dumbed-down population. Hence, there is one curriculum for the masses while the ruling class is reproduced by schools outside its ambit.

This starkly obvious reality is muddled by airdropping several myths into the discourse – none of which can bear the weight of evidence. The first pertains to the wonders that would result from packing even more religious content in the school curriculum. It cleverly manipulates societal values while ignoring evidence that religious education is not correlated at all with any indicator of development and not even with the value of goodness itself. The outcome of the Zia experiment should be sufficient to dispel the myth.

The second myth is that a single national curriculum (SNC) would yield an equal, stable, and peaceful society. There is no example in history of a mere school curriculum yielding such lofty dividends. As it is, the lack of any serious commitment to the goal of equality is evident at the outset by the retention of schools that can bypass the SNC. Add to that the fact that instability in the country is almost entirely the outcome of conflicts between elites educated in the same schools under the same curriculum. That should be enough to expose the emptiness of the claim.

While the aim of the SNC – dumbing down the population the better to perpetuate the rule of Brown Englishmen – cannot be camouflaged from any serious analyst, there are among the critics some who believe that teaching everyone in English, even under an SNC, can level the playing field and enable the masses to compete with the elite. Their efforts are thus diverted into a blind alley giving the SNC a free pass. Once again, there is no evidence from history of such an outcome from everyone learning in the same language. The US is the most striking example of the fallacy of such a belief.

On the other hand, so much evidence has accumulated over decades that the languages spoken at home are the best for a child’s early education that one must wonder what is going on in the minds of the proponents of English as the language of instruction. On what basis can they argue for the proposition in the face so much evidence, both from controlled research studies and from direct experience of countries teaching in their own languages?

All I can think of is that this is a manifestation of a perverse contrariness – because the elite’s children are taught in English, why should the common people be deprived of that privilege? This ignores completely the welfare of the child. The elite is the elite not because it can speak English but because it was either born or has bought its way into privilege.

Even a cursory probing of Pakistan’s ruling class would reveal that speaking English has no correlation with superior wisdom. The proponents of English are prepared to sacrifice the intelligence of their children to satisfy a strange sense of envy. This ‘English Revolution’ – snatching English from the aristocracy – would be our non-violent equivalent of the French Revolution. I wonder what Gandhi would have to say of this approach to gaining equality.

The other explanation relies on Khaled Ahmed’s distinction between Urdu as the language of ‘emotive walwala’ and English of ‘reasoned discourse’ on the basis of which he favours the latter as the language of instruction. Going by this hard-to-accept hypothesis, I can only conclude that the proponents of English, although educated in the language, continue, naoozubillah, to think in the vernacular.

The solution might then be to aim for native fluency in English so that everyone can actually think in it and has no need at all to be held back by the malevolent burden of native languages. What a pleasure it would be to see our ministers transforming into little Shakespeares.

The evidence on what is the best language of instruction for a child is overwhelming and considered settled. Any critical engagement that does not feel compelled to take sides would arrive at that conclusion. What remains of interest is to figure out why there are people who are still not swayed by the evidence and think it is a subject on which they can start from first principles with their prejudices as the point of departure.",neutral
"As an educationist, I am appalled by the Single National Curriculum. As a Pakistani, I am disappointed but not surprised.

I have articulated my reservations in a series of opinion pieces. They have to do with the process (non-transparent and non-participatory, excluding the principal stakeholders) and the pedagogy (old-fashioned, privileging memorization over thinking). But it is equally important to explore why the SNC has taken this particular form.

I was discussing the SNC with a successful, well-educated executive and asked if she would put a child she was responsible for, say a grandchild, into a school teaching from the SNC. Absolutely not, she said without a moment’s hesitation and with a shudder of dread. I asked if, in her opinion, any senior bureaucrat in grades 20, 21, or 22 would enroll a grandchild in a SNC school. Absolutely not, she said again. She was less sure of politicians – they are such a motley bunch, she said.

This does need a survey to nail down comprehensively but I am reasonably confident how the results would come out. Successful people want their children to be successful and they know the education that can deliver such achievement privileges thinking and not memorization. It is no surprise that these successful people have made sure the main plank of the SNC – equality across schools – has been consigned to the dust bin. They can now breathe easy that the O/A Levels and IB schools shall remain undisturbed.

I don’t have any quarrel with such an attitude that is an outright rejection of the SNC. But the question that follows is why the successful don’t agitate for a similar quality of education for all children and not just their own? After all, every child is a citizen with equal rights entitled to the same set of opportunities guaranteed by the state.

It is not a given that education for poor children has to be poor in quality. Retired Chief Justice Jawwad Khawaja and his wife run the Harsukh school for children from villages around their home. They have enough confidence in the Harsukh curriculum to enroll their own grandchildren in the same school.

The only plausible explanation for the SNC is that Pakistan is not one nation but two – that of the rulers and of the ruled. The rulers need to learn how to think in order to lead while the ruled need to memorize the lessons of obedience in order to be good and contented followers. The more so, for the rulers are not rulers because of any exceptional talent or achievement on a level playing field but because they have inherited the mantle in a milieu in which all competition is effectively crippled.

A more frightening thought: forty percent of children below five in Pakistan are stunted, among the highest percentages in the world. This fact has been known to the state for decades and nothing has been done to redress it. Is the SNC then designed for children who are already doomed and cannot handle anything that requires creative thinking?

Or, is the SNC designed for the poor to further cripple the remaining competition and to mould them into pliant followers? This might also explain why people who come up with these kinds of educational programmes never ever consult those for whom the programmes are intended. They decide for them which, in reality, means that the designs are intended to maximize the privilege of those with the power to decide.

This denial of participation is particularly striking in a country that professes Islam, a religion with such a heavy emphasis on consultation, especially of those for whom something is being decided. How does one explain such an un-Islamic practice in an Islamic country except by questioning the sincerity of the Islamic pretensions of its rulers?

My suggestion to the minister for education is to live up to the Islamic ideal and engage in a broad-based consultation with citizens. The minister might want to assemble the leading members of his team and engage in an in-depth debate with a set of leading experts like Pervez Hoodbhoy, AH Nayyar, Tariq Rahman, Rubina Saigol, and Zubeida Mustafa. The debates could be held in all the major district towns of the country spread over a period of twelve months with the audience composed predominantly of parents whose children are to be the beneficiaries of the SNC.

I wouldn’t presume to know where the parents would come out at the end but, at the very least, their silence should not be passed off as approval. It is patently unjust to decide something so momentous for others without a sincere consultation. Avoiding such a debate and rushing ahead with a show of force is a sign of weakness that undermines both the democratic and the Islamic credentials of the government.

In closing, an apt couplet from Ghalib (not all memorization is bad – but no one imposed it on me before I could understand what it meant):

"Frankly, the Single New Curriculum is so absurd that one would have to be a masochist to wade through its details. Trust our governments to come up with ridiculous things that are completely without merit but that consume so much time that could be better spent resolving the real issues of real people.

Nevertheless, education is a matter of vital importance and one has to engage if only to prevent our children having done to them in spades what Ziaul Haq did to their parents. That, indirectly, should also tell you where this curriculum is coming from and how brilliant Ziaul Haq’s children have turned out to be.

Let us begin from the beginning and try and figure out what ought to be the concerns of an education policy.

First, and this should be obvious, there is a need to raise the horribly awful standard of school education in the country. In case you doubt my word, ask why Pakistan does not participate in any of the international comparisons of the quality of education across countries? Where do you think it would rank if someone could convince our government to put their system to an open test? Who do you think would rank lower? Want to bet?

Second, and this should also be obvious, there is a need to provide equal access to quality education for all students. It is just preposterous how privilege is transmitted from generation to generation in this country. People fortunate enough to be affluent, by hook or by crook, have been sending their children to the few good schools in the country and, no matter how mediocre, the latter, with the help of quotas when nothing else works, have been filling the positions of power and authority over generations. If in doubt, just look at the calibre of the people in our parliaments and in our cabinets.

Meanwhile, in a country of 220 million people, there are thousands of really brilliant children, many of whom do not even get to go to school. Some I can vouch for as I have personally worked with them. One sat for the CSS twice and failed English each time. There we have it: the biggest single barrier to entry that keeps out the truly talented and lets in the mediocre who have had the money to go to an English-medium school.

You are not going to tell me we have to wait to benefit from all this latent wasted talent till our Single New Curriculum can raise everyone’s standard of English to the point where there will be a level playing field. I will answer that you are either being stupid or dishonest or both.

Do we have to use English as the screen to admit the best candidates or can we not admit the best candidates and give a year-long intensive course in English to those who need it? Don’t we send our Foreign Service inductees to other counties to learn their languages in a year? Why can’t we do the same for English? The answer obviously depends on the definition of ‘best.’ If the best are those who can speak English, then you are happy to adopt that absurd stand because it protects your privilege.

Better yet, why not see language as a means not an end and have all entrance examinations in the language of choice and then see who gets in and who gets left out. What is likely to happen to the quality of the entering cohorts? At the same time, what is likely to happen to the hierarchy of privilege that exists undisturbed in this country in which Independence has only meant the replacement of the White Englishman with the Brown Englishman who, sadly, is not half as good.

And, please, don’t give me all that rubbish about English being the global language and that we will be left behind if we don’t know it. You just reveal your dismal IQ by making that argument. First, we have already been left way behind, despite all the fluent Oxbridge luminaries in our governments and brilliant decision-making bodies that produce documents like the Single National Curriculum.

Second, the Koreans and the Chinese know much less English than we do, teach in their own languages, and are now vying for global leadership. They teach their students English later when they need it. Third, to know English one doesn’t need to emerge speaking it from the mother’s womb. In fact, there is a huge amount of evidence that children do better learning English later if their first language is not English.

But evidence is always ignored when privilege is at stake and all sorts of weird arguments show up when dependence has to be maintained and when contenders to the limited seats of power are to be kept out. Recall that in the American South during slavery, it was a crime for a slave to learn and for a non-slave to even attempt to teach a slave. Our rulers can’t go that far for education as a right is conceded in the constitution and they need the votes but they can do the next worst thing to the serfs – make sure no one learns anything by starving the school system of all resources and, to boot, using the appointments of teachers and principals for distributing patronage.

Are you telling me that our brilliant rulers really do not know how to improve schooling and need to invite Sir Michael Barber on some huge fee to tell them? If they don’t know even this, should they be in charge of the entire country in the first place?

So, what is to be done – given that no one really wants to do anything except divert attention from real issues by letting loose red herrings like the Single New Curriculum? If you really want me to tell you, I would be happy to do so. And I will not charge a fee either because it is not rocket science.",neutral
"Official figures suggest that the pandemic has abated in Pakistan. This is welcome news but we need to be sure. It would be unfortunate either if the verdict is wrong or if real gains are undone through premature relaxation.

I have some misgivings based on observations since the beginning of the epidemic. At the outset, I noted the remarkably casual attitude of individuals implementing measures to control the disease with many not following SOPs themselves.

I then tracked the case of a neighbour who tested positive for Covid-19 in a house with eight other residents. No one from the local health authorities called for contact tracing. A few days later, the person died in a hospital. Still, no one in the house was traced and tested.

I encountered families who let symptomatic elders die at home rather than visit a hospital or be tested, preferring a ‘proper’ burial to a few extra years of life and the risk of being ostracised by neighbours. Such behaviour could yield significant under-reporting of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Empty hospital beds, confirmed by many doctors, are not sufficient proof the pandemic has abated.

All along, I hardly saw real social distancing or effective use of masks. Many local markets remained busy, with people finding ways to work around restrictions. This was particularly widespread during the extended Eidul Fitr break when both shopping and travel returned to near-normal.

The most striking event was ten of the 25 members of the national cricket team testing positive before leaving for England. These were young men in their prime, athletically fit and well-nourished which suggested possible high prevalence of infection in the young. True, all of them were asymptomatic but they remained potential virus carriers. With that order of prevalence in the young and fit, what could one say about older people especially those with comorbidities?

The fact is that not much can be said without the benefit of testing, and if testing is reduced the number of confirmed infections would fall. Further, if people avoid testing and hospitals out of choice or fear, recorded deaths would decline. In addition, the positivity statistic might be distorted by increasing numbers of healthy people being tested to meet requirements for air travel.

These observations suggest that there are justified grounds for caution — independent confirmatory evidence is needed. Such evidence is not hard to furnish; one can count the dead and compare the numbers with previous years.

Many countries are now releasing such data on excess deaths to demonstrate progress in controlling the epidemic. In Spain, for example, at the height of the epidemic, fatalities were 155 percent more than the corresponding week in 2019. By the middle of May, excess deaths were down to zero, confirming control of the epidemic for the moment.

No such data has been released in Pakistan but what little has become available corroborates the phenomenon of excess deaths. A BBC report dated July 5 contained comparative data for June 2020 and June 2019 on confirmed burials in selected graveyards under municipal jurisdictions in Lahore and Karachi.

The burials in June 2020 were between 50 percent and 181 percent higher than those in June 2019. The number of burials attributed to Covid-19 ranged between 10 and and 40 percent of the excess deaths, the rest remaining unexplained.

This suggests either that Covid-19 deaths are being significantly under-reported or that non-Covid deaths have increased greatly above average because of impaired medical access, patients staying away from hospitals, or being unable to afford medications and treatment. The actual situation is probably worse because one would expect the lockdown to reduce deaths below the norm due to fewer traffic accidents and reduced air pollution.

Release of comparable data for July would answer many questions on how the epidemic is trending. If excess deaths in the same graveyards in July are well below those for June, it would be independent confirmation of a decline in the epidemic’s intensity.

If the intensity has actually declined, there could be a number of explanations that can only be confirmed later. Deaths could have remained relatively low because of the minimal number of infections imported from abroad given Pakistan’s pariah status as a tourist destination, or because of the very youthful age distribution of the population, or lower than anticipated infectivity as suggested by a very recent paper in the Quarterly Journal of Medicine (‘Secondary Attack Rate of Covid-19 in household contacts: Systematic review,’ 29 July, 2020). The last hypothesis can be validated via a follow-up survey of households reporting Covid-19 deaths. My check on the household of the neighbour mentioned earlier revealed no other person with symptoms after a month.

It would indeed be ironic if lax implementation of disease control measures has hastened herd immunity, something suggested by the experience of the cricket team. This outcome can also be easily confirmed by a well-designed protocol of randomised serological testing.

The death rate in many developed countries has fallen because the most vulnerable, especially the very old with comorbidities resident in crowded institutional homes, succumbed early in large numbers leaving behind those with better immunity. This is akin to a forest fire rapidly consuming the dry tinder before being slowed down by the remaining healthy trees. But this explanation does not apply to Pakistan where the total number of reported deaths has been relatively small.

In the absence of independent confirmatory evidence, it is not clear whether the virus has been really controlled or if there is a dangerous sense of complacency that would give it a nasty second life. It is possible to provide robust evidence to ease doubts.

Hopeful pronouncements mixed with dire warnings are a poor substitute for convincing evidence. Everyone would benefit from an end to the uncertainty and fear that are preventing a graduated resumption of activities to enable the most badly affected to restore their livelihoods.",neutral
"At its most basic, education has two dimensions – what is taught and how it is taught. Everyone would agree that the most excellent content can be taught very poorly. It is less obvious that good pedagogy can overcome the handicap of indifferent content by enabling students to self-learn, a skill they can use to find content that meets their needs.

This reflection should lead to the conclusion that how we teach is more important than what we teach. Even more so in an age when old content dates rapidly and new content is added daily. In such times the only skill that ensures survival is that of self-learning beyond the classroom.

We no longer live in times in which students were prepared for careers that lasted lifetimes, and for which they required foundational training to which they added incrementally by learning on the job. Today, careers are here today and gone tomorrow – and students need cognitive abilities to adapt to radically altered job markets.

In such times, the approach to teaching also needs to adapt. Pedagogy itself can be viewed in two ways – the first emphasizes filling students’ heads with information that some authority or committee considers useful and training them for the job market; the second stresses nurturing the intellectual development of students to enable the full realization of their potential, whatever it may be.

Once again, it should be obvious which approach is more relevant in our times given the rate at which information becomes obsolete. Consider how many who studied physics and chemistry in high school remember what they were asked to memorize. The purpose of having such subjects in the curriculum was not to memorize the speed of light or the periodic table but to learn to be surprised, to ask questions, formulate hypotheses, devise experiments, record observations, and derive logical conclusions. Those skills, if acquired, became second nature, and lasted a lifetime proving valuable across any number of domains.

Much of these insights were ignored when education was transformed into a vehicle to mass produce workers for an industrial age – an age when training, discipline, and compliant behaviour were attributes most desired by most employers. As an added benefit, such education also produced placid citizens who would not question their rulers.

But the insights themselves were known since much earlier times. Socrates described education as the kindling of a flame, not the filling of an empty vessel. His focus throughout his teaching life was on the acquisition of self-knowledge by the individual and his method of choice was to teach learning through questioning, the celebrated Socratic Method.

We don’t teach Ghalib anymore as it is worthless in the job market, or if we do it is only to memorize six ghazals by grade 5 and recite two of them (not necessarily on pitch because music is not fit for the classroom). But if we had, we would have recognized the Socratic Method in just this one couplet: “kya farz hai kih sab ko mile ek-sa javaab / aa o nah ham bhi sair kareN koh-e tuur ki” (Is it a given that all will get the same response / Come let us also take a stroll around Mount Tuur)

Of course, one would also have had to know some history to figure out ‘koh-e tuur’ – but that too we have discarded as useless.

Thinking along these lines should alert us to the danger of choosing education that is content heavy, and pedagogy that aims to fill an empty vessel. We will inevitably fill our children’s heads with whatever content is deemed ‘right’ at a particular time to serve the ends of adults. That is both dangerous and unfair to children who are unable to protest such manipulation of their lives.

Kindling a flame avoids such dangers. For example, anyone taught to question and sift evidence would be sceptical of the belief that one can be taught to be good in a classroom – had that been the case one would not have had the problems in the Catholic Church. They would be similarly sceptical of a slogan like ‘One Nation, One Curriculum’ – having observed what happened to ‘One Nation, One Language.’

The argument that one can have the best of both worlds – the head can be filled with content and the mind can be allowed full reign to be creative – has not been proved anywhere. Students tend to one mode or the other. They mostly conform, though some rebel; Bertrand Russell famously said that schooling does not succeed in destroying everyone.

The SNC has to be evaluated on two counts. First, is it focused on how to teach rather than on what to teach, and is it abreast of modern trends in education? And, second, does its pedagogy subscribe to kindling a flame or to filling an empty vessel? If the latter, who will decide what will be filled into the empty vessels?

The last is an especially important question. Setting all my misgivings apart, I shall be prepared to bless the SNC if I am shown a chapter, vetted by reputable historians, that students are asked to memorize on what happened in East Pakistan. How many of our students born in this century even know that Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan?

How many of the rest recall the song we were made to sing with such patriotic fervour that had this line about Golden Bengal – “vahan ka bachcha bachcha apni qaum pe marne waala hai” (every single child there is willing to die for his/her nation). Which nation? Our committees have erased all that history from what is to be filled into the heads of our future generations.

For educationists, the SNC is sadly wanting on all counts; it is a cut-and-paste exercise that is confused, outdated, outmoded, and a minefield of unintended consequences. It needs to be revisited in good faith and with an open mind.

Parents need to voice their opinions on whether they want their children to be blinkered, compliant cogs in a political game or confident, thoughtful innovators ready for the future. Just as goodness and patriotism cannot be taught in a class, neither can innovation or entrepreneurship – these are attitudes of the mind that emerge out of a process of learning that kindles a flame.

Half a couplet from Ghalib is the best summing up of the learning process I can think of: “tuutii ko shash jihat se muqaabil hai aaiiinah” (the parrot is confronted from all six directions by a mirror).

In our tradition, talking parrots were taught to speak by making them see their own reflection in a mirror while an unseen human voiced the words. What happens when the mirror is distorted?

The point to ponder is whether we are raising thinking human beings able to comprehend the truth, whatever it is, or parrots regurgitating platitudes that their masters wish to hear. Not to forget that even parrots trained through distorted mirrors can only take that much distortion without losing their minds and poking out the eyes of their trainers.",neutral
"Every single person is at risk – even Prince Charles and Boris Johnson have tested positive – which makes this a crisis unprecedented in living memory and a supreme test of leadership.

No one will get everything right but no one can afford to get everything wrong. Where leaders come out on the spectrum will determine how many live or die in each country. And the number of days it takes to arrive at the right decisions will determine the quantum of avoidable deaths.

Regimes can be characterised by a set of attributes – integrity, transparency, competence, legitimacy, authority. An ideal regime would possess all: it would be honest, transparent and competent, trusted by citizens and with the authority to get things done. In the real world, we have to make do with some mix that allows countries to muddle through for better or worse in normal times.

It is in times of great crises that the relative balance between these attributes stands out with striking salience. It is no use having an honest regime that is incompetent. It is only a little better to have a competent regime distrusted by its citizens. Amongst the attributes, competence clearly commands centrality – without it all is lost – but it needs to be accompanied by either trust or authority to translate policy into action.

Consider the response of various countries to the current pandemic in this perspective. The Chinese regime was non-transparent, trying to cover up the problem till the number of deaths made that impossible. A study claims that if the same interventions had been made three weeks earlier, infections could have been slashed by 95 percent. Even so, once it decided to act it did so with competence backed by the authority, if not the trust, to compel compliance with draconian measures.

South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore were high on almost all attributes and have positive outcomes to show for it. In these countries, as well as in China, the key was decisive action. Transparency enabled an early start to prevent avoidable deaths. Trust helped avoid recourse to coercive authority for compliance.

It is not the case that there was only one right remedy to follow everywhere. The above-mentioned countries adopted varying paths depending on what they felt would work best in their context. What was common was that the action was decisive, even when it was delayed as in China. It also comes across very clearly that in each country there was an overall strategy and a tightly coordinated plan to guide the implementation.

This raises the crucial question: How does leadership arrive at the strategy to be followed, convince the citizens of its logic, and arrange to have it implemented? One would assume it would elicit the best advice possible from credible domain specialists to determine the strategy, communicate it honestly to the public, commit the government to its implementation, and appoint the most competent administrators to do so.

The last thing one would want is for the leader to assume the role of the expert and choose strategy based on gut feelings, hunches or personal faith. Even less would one want implementation to be parcelled out to friends – no matter how honest or well-intentioned they may be. Consider, as an example, the path followed by Donald Trump as a result of which the US is now the centre of the pandemic with all the resources of the richest country insufficient to contain the damage.

The US is fortunate that there are competent experts and administrators who are valiantly trying to mitigate the damage caused by their President. But what is to be done in countries where people are neither appointed nor promoted on the basis of competency, where leaders feel they know everything that needs be known, where the population does not trust the leadership, where the authority to implement is weak, and where administrators can’t distinguish between a holding pen, a quarantine and an isolation ward?

Some remedies need to be found in a hurry if the worst-case outcome is to be avoided. The first step is to assemble a panel of credible domain specialists and introduce it to the citizenry.

The panel would recommend a home-grown strategy considering not just the nature of the virus but that of the population that has to be convinced and protected. It would weigh, for example, how much a lockdown will buy if mosques remain open while parks are padlocked or if mandis have to remain functional to ensure essential supplies? How long can a lockdown be sustained where millions survive on what they earn every day? What does social isolation mean where many live eight to a room? How do those lacking water and money wash their hands frequently with soap?

All these answers have to be found quickly which is why there is a need to locate the most qualified experts whether from home or abroad and whether politically acceptable or otherwise. This is not the time for settling scores, doling out favours, or applying ideological litmus tests. Too much is at stake for business-as-usual.

In this spirit, an off-the-wall choice to implement the consensus strategy in Pakistan could demonstrate the seriousness with which the ongoing crisis is being viewed and the extent to which parochial interests can be set aside for national welfare. What would it take to make Shahbaz Sharif the Corona Czar in Punjab? There is no one else in the province the public considers more decisive and capable as an administrator. Notwithstanding his misplaced vision and priorities for development, given a well-defined task there is no one else who inspires more confidence in the ability to get things done.

Let this be Shahbaz Sharif’s path to redemption. With Murad Shah doing a credible job in Sindh, this could open a path beyond the acrimony and distrust that has crippled the politics of the country to the lasting misfortune of its people. We could move towards a saner, more hopeful, future and we may also save a lot of lives in the bargain.",neutral
"It is a fact that few outside Pakistan consider the most recent electoral exercise to have been even-handed. Even partisans benefiting from the outcome, while offering various justifications, hardly dispute the crux of such objections. Does this come at a price? And, if so, what kind of price?

First, there is a clear loss of institutional credibility. While in the past such developments were attributed to individuals, the narrative this time is depersonalised and centred on institutional symbols. There are slogans in the air that have never been heard before.

Second, there are many Pakistanis who see some immense good happening because the previous dispensation was allegedly so corrupt and anti-national that five more years for them would have spelled disaster for the country. So this predicament arguably legitimised the replacement of the predecessors with an upright and patriotic team. If the expectations of this segment of the population are proven to be wrong yet again, it could lead to a crisis of credibility for the power structure. Third, the probability that the above-mentioned expectations are fulfilled is not very high.

Leave aside the fact that the new dispensation is peopled largely by the same individuals who were part of the erstwhile lot of the corrupt, and subscribe, for the sake of argument, to the comforting myth that an honest leader can keep them in check. Nevertheless, there is no escaping the reality that no leader, however upright personally, can defy the structural imperatives that define a system and circumscribe the room for manoeuvre.

To start with, there are structural imperatives that push from below in a society characterised by widespread poverty and the dependence of the many on the few for rights and entitlements. With a parliamentary system, and the majority of electoral constituencies having a dominant rural vote, such a configuration cannot but throw up the kinds of power brokers now characterised as ‘electables.’ The motivations of such representatives, who have dominated Pakistani politics throughout, are well known and they do not barter their loyalties for free. Let us assume, however, that a truly great leader can keep them in check.

But then there are structural imperatives from above. A leader beholden to the power elite cannot but acquiesce to its dictates – which means that foreign and defence policies could remain out of bounds. At the same time, if the leader is not inclined to take on the theocracy, the internal dynamics are unlikely to change, if not become more dangerous (consider the abject surrender on Atif Mian). Add to this the constraints that would accompany the recourse to the IMF that has already been signalled as inevitable, and the fiscal vice would tighten some more.

Pakistani politicians stand very much reduced to the status of princes in pre-Independence India who were rulers only in name while power was exercised by the British; they can revel and indulge their egos in their restricted domains while the real business is conducted elsewhere.

It is not the fault of the politicians, just a reflection of the reality on the ground. To their credit, the princes left us a glorious cultural heritage of art, poetry and music that continues to enrich our lives and provide solace in trying times. Our politicians have focused on enriching themselves and adding concrete to our lives. Imran Khan may make different choices but he would nevertheless be operating at the margins, turning opulent rest houses into hotels and colleges.

This is ironic because the broad framework outlined by Imran Khan points in the right direction – the country can move ahead only if it prioritises the productive uplift of the bottom forty percent and invests heavily in its security and human capital. But will there be enough left to do that after satisfying the obligations of all the paymasters listed above – defence, debt repayments, conditionalities, luxury imports, political payoffs, and the inevitable leakages – which would leave the kitty bare and beyond the reach of minor austerities and absurdities like forbidding cheese and inviting donations to build dams?

When Imran Khan recognises these constraints, as he inevitably will, and attempts to wriggle free of any of them, he will face the same reality as all those who have had the crown placed on their heads before him. And so one might expect the cycle to repeat and the status quo sustained. But there might well be an accompanying downward drift with the continued erosion of institutions and their loss of credibility. Already, we are in a surreal situation in which every organ of the state is carrying out functions intended for another. This is not a lasting arrangement and the lost time in which competing economies move further ahead could exert an enormous toll.

Pakistan has a very young population, one that is poorly educated and trained and which is looking for employment to survive. What will happen when its dreams dissolve and its survival is at stake? I suppose one could tell them to go climb one of the trees that might be sprouting by that time.

On the other hand, the descent into anarchy could accelerate. The power elite would flee to foreign abodes – Dubai, Jeddah, Paris, London – and the parties that have been mainstreamed as part of electoral engineering would step in to destroy the old and rotting system once and for all. This might well be a triumph that could bear the mark of a colossal tragedy in the making.",neutral
"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet on Wednesday constituted a committee to work out solutions to ballooning circular debt that is causing liquidity shortage in the crippled power sector.


The ECC took the decision during a meeting presided over by Adviser to Prime Minister on Finance Hafeez Shaikh.

The committee comprises representatives from finance, power, petroleum, planning divisions, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan State Oil, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, Pakistan Petroleum Limited, Government Holdings (Private) Limited, and Pakistan LNG Limited.

The committee was tasked to prepare a proposal on modalities for clearing the circular debt of the petroleum division. The committee will prepare a well-rounded proposal in a month and submit before the ECC.

The officials were directed to holistically consider the issue of circular debt and work out the solution.

Circular debt in the power sector crossed Rs2 trillion as of June this year due to higher losses, power theft, inefficiencies and low recovery of bills from consumers by power distribution companies. This high debt level means serious liquidity issue in the entire energy chain, leading to frequent power outages.

The meeting was further told the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) opened a fresh tender to import 110,000 tons of wheat, taking the finalised deals of the state-owned company to more than 700,000 tons.

Officials of the ministry of national food security and research told the meeting that it opened the 6th tender for 110,000 tons of wheat and after price matching the total picked up quantity would reach 320,000 tons.

They said there would be sufficient availability of wheat in the country by January 2021 and with the increase in supply, the prices would be lowered eventually.

TCP finalised deals to import 660,000 tons of wheat while it was given a target of 1.5 million tons. TCP’s two cargoes, carrying 100,000 tons of wheat, have arrived in Pakistan. TCP’s first wheat consignment of 55,125 tons was arrived on October 7 and the second shipment of 55,000 tons arrived on 8th October. Wheat production is expected at 25.2 million tons for this year with shortfall estimated at 1.6 million tons.

ECC also enhanced the quota of Gilgit Baltistan by another 10,000 tons of wheat from 150,000 tons to 160,000 tons. The modalities for increased quota will be decided later.

ECC approved technical supplementary grants for the National Accountability Bureau, ministry of health for immunization program and ministry of religious affairs on account of Hajj expenses and for anti-narcotics force.",neutral
"ISLAMABAD: Privatisation Commission (PC) Board has decided to place a case before the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) to decide the future status of three unsold properties, as the other 23 properties have been auctioned fetching Rs1.113 billion.

Federal Minister for Privatisation Mohammed Mian Soomro chaired the PC Board meeting on Wednesday here and decided to place the case of these remaining properties for delisting or otherwise.

These properties including Republic Motors Lahore, Commerce Division’s land in Multan and land in Rahim Yar Khan owned by Aviation Division. The CCoP is going to meet on Friday (23 October).

According to the summary of CCoP available with The News, the committee will discuss the approval of transaction structure of privatisation of Heavy Electric Complex (HEC), transaction structure of Pakistan Steel Mills, revisit privatisation of House Building Finance Corporation Ltd transaction.

Besides, it will also discuss the privatisation status of National Power Parks Management Company Limited (NPPMCL) that owns two RLNG-based power plants located at Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah, which have a combined generation capacity of 2,453 megawatts.

The agenda also includes the guidelines for heads of Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) which are on the government’s privatisation programme list.

The PC Board also discussed the auction results of federal government owned properties. The government-owned 26 properties were specified for the open public auction and the process started on 7th September and culminated on 28th September, 2020.

Out of 26 properties, 23 were successfully auctioned with Rs1.113 billion auction proceeds against the Rs1.011 billion reserved price. It also approved the bidders’ price for the auctioned properties.

It is pertinent to mention that the in recent meeting of Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) assets management on privatisation, the representative of the Ministry of Industries & Production proposed that the Republic Motors Lahore (RML) be delisted owing to the litigation involved as the 35 percent of the property is owned by private owners and eviction of 51 tenants would require a considerable length of time. It is therefore suggested by the PC Board members that the decision relating to its status be decided by the CCoP.

The last item was about the Wapda Rest House, KP. The auction had to be postponed as the provincial government requested to allot/handover the property, hence the Privatisation Board members recommended that the subject property be delisted from the privatisation list and the proposal be placed before CCoP.

Soomro reiterated, “We are cognizant of all the rules and regulations and hence moving ahead steadily by consulting all relevant forums and are undertaking every transaction/auction in transparent manner.”",neutral
"ISLAMABAD: The ballooning power sector circular debt is haunting the government and has become a headache for the power sector policymakers, as in one year, it has increased by a third to Rs 2.1 trillion till June 2020, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has reported in its latest report.

According to the Nepra State of the Industry Report 2020, the circular debt stood at Rs 1.6 trillion in June 2019 that jumped to Rs 2.1 trillion in June 2020, registering an increase of 32 per cent. The reasons for the increase in the debt were higher losses, power theft, inefficiencies and low recovery of bills from consumers by power distribution companies (Discos).

The regulator noted that the high cost of electricity, inefficient distribution services and load-shedding policy on high loss-making feeders is pushing consumers away from the Discos. It is high cost of electricity due to which theft of electricity and non-payment of electricity bill is high.

The installed power generation capacity of Pakistan as on June 30, 2020 stands at 38,719 MW as compared to 38,995 MW on June 30, 2019, showing a net decrease of 276 MW. During the year, the transmission and distribution (T&D) losses of Tesco, Qesco and Pesco increased in comparison with the last year. Whereas the T&D losses of Iesco, Gepco, Lesco, Fesco, Mepco, Hesco and Sepco decreased in comparison with FY 2018-19. The combined recovery of all Discos during FY 2019-20 remained 88.77% as compared to 90.25% during FY 2018-19 showing an overall decrease of 1.48% in recoveries in comparison with the last year.

The receivables from public and private consumers as well as the delayed payments of subsidies are causing increase in circular debt. Discos are required not only to improve recovery from public and private consumers but also to actively follow up with the relevant governments for timely recovery of subsidy amounts.

The load-shedding policy is compelling the consumers for use of smaller inefficient gas or diesel generators as well as Un-interrupted Power Supply (UPS) which has disrupted the efficient allocation of valuable resources in the economy.

The high cost of electricity, inefficient distribution services and load-shedding policy on high loss feeders is pushing consumers away from Discos. The distributed generation through solar power solutions has made a significant ingress in the domestic consumer base of Discos which are losing consumers with high consumption and paying capacity. Similarly, the commercial, educational and industrial outfits are also inclined to drift away from Discos and opt for self-generation through solar power. So far, nearly 5,000 Net-Metering Licences with around 86 MW electric power generation capacity have been issued by the Nepra. Apart from the distributed generation, various industrial and commercial consumers of Discos, dissatisfied with the higher cost and poor quality of services, tend to directly purchase electricity from generation companies for reliable and cheaper electricity supply through wheeling arrangements.

The power sector reforms envisaged a transition from monopoly structure to a competitive market; an objective which has not been achieved yet. Discos, which were supposed to be independent commercial entities, are instead tied centrally, having the least say in their own commercial decisions. Similarly, the Public Sector Generation Companies (Gencos) have also been centrally tied by the creation of Genco Holding Company Limited (GHCL). Any attempt to further protect the monopolistic and oligopolistic status quo may not only hurt the power sector but also the overall economic growth of the country, the report warned.

The statistics show that during FY 2019-20, the total electricity generation in the country was 134,745.70 GWh compared to 136,532 GWh electricity generation during FY 2018-19 showing a decrease of 1,786.30 GWh. Further, 513.74 GWh has also been imported from Iran during FY 2019-20 as compared to 486.80 GWh imports during FY 2018-19 showing an increase of 26.94 GWh.

During FY 2019-20, Wapda hydel generated 37,425.41 GWh electricity compared to 31,167.85 GWh last year, showing an increase of 6,257.56 GWh. During the same period, the hydel IPPs generated 1,562.55 GWh electricity as compared to 1,928.04 GWh during FY 2018-19, showing a decrease of 365.49 GWh. The share of hydel generation in the generation basket of CPPA-G during FY 2019-20 remained 30.77% while this share was 25.35% during FY 2018-19.

The total electricity generation of Gencos during FY 2019-20 remained 7,907.91 GWh as compared to 13,016.93 GWh during FY 2018-19, showing a decrease of 5,109.02 GWh.",neutral
"ISLAMABAD: Air Marshal Arshad Malik, CEO Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), on Tuesday said the government was not selling Roosevelt Hotel in New York; however, it would be shut down by December 31 for renovation and deliberations on its future.

“The PIA has approached the privatisation commission through the federal government, which will hire a financial consultant via an international tendering process to devise the future course of action, considering all the available options,” Malik said while briefing Senate Standing Committee on Aviation that met under the chair of Senator Mushahidullah Khan.

“It will be decided later whether necessary renovation or repair work be carried out or the existing building be demolished for reconstruction and raising a 100-storey hotel for which local bylaws are conducive.”

The committee also sought a detailed briefing from the Pakistan International Airlines Company Limited (PIACL)’s Board of Director (BoD) on financial stability plan and future vision to transform the national flag-carrier into a profit-earning entity.

The PIA chief said the declining business of the hotel was further aggravated due to the coronavirus pandemic, and could increase the company’s losses to $6 million/year. Senator Mushahidullah Khan, chairman of the committee said, the PIA should consider reopening of the routes where the COVID-19 issues had been addressed especially Japan and China.

Khan said his committee would support the positive development and initiatives of the PIA administration for the betterment of its services as the airliner was passing through a tough time.

It was further apprised that PIA’s Roosevelt Hotel, a 19-storey building located at a prime location, was acquired in 1978 on partnership, from its own profits and as a part of PIA diversification strategy.

In 1999, Senator Khan said, it acquired 100 percent shareholding at $36.5 million from its own resources and without any aid from the government.

The property had more than a thousand rooms, having an area of 43,313 square feet, and it was run by the world’s premier Hotel Management Company ‘Interstate Hotel and Resorts’ USA.

The committee was told that current market value of the hotel, assessed by M/s Deloitte, was $662 million based on the highest and the best use.

The financial position of the hotel had been in the ‘Red’, mainly due to debt servicing, unionisation, dilapidated building, infrastructure, rooms and public area conditions, which needed immediate upgrade and major repairs in life of severe weather conditions.",neutral
"ISLAMABAD: Fueled by runaway food prices, Pakistan’s headline national inflation has accelerated faster than expected to 9.04 percent in September 2020, against August reading of 8.2 percent.

The most worrisome fact of the latest CPI bulletin released here on Friday by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) is that rural inflation increased much faster than urban inflation. Urban inflation was recorded at 7.7 percent while rural inflation stood at 11.1pc during September 2020.

Last year in September 2019, the CPI was recorded at 11.4 percent, the PakistanBureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday reported. In FY20 (July-June 2019/20), the average inflation was recorded at 10.74pc, with peak reading in January of 14.56 percent year-on-year.

The latest CPI bulletin says that on month-on-month basis, inflation increased by 1.5pc in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 0.6pc in the previous month and an increase of 0.8pc in September 2019.

CPI is a main gauge of price changes at the retail level of all goods and services consumed by private households and roughly reflect changes in cost of living of entire Pakistan. According to the CPI basket, on average each Pakistani spends 34.58 per cent of his income on food and beverages, 23.63 per cent on house rent, water, gas, electricity and fuel, 8.6pc on clothing & footwear; 6.92pc on hoteling, 5.91pc on transportation, 4.1 pc on furnishing & household equipment maintenance, 3.79pc on education, 2.7 pc on health, 2.21pc on communication, but the least it spends 1.59pc of its income spend on recreation & culture.

Food inflation in September 2020 stood at 14.74 pc against 12.89 pc in previous month. It was followed by clothing & footwear prices with an increase of 9.13 pc, health charges 8.25pc, hoteling 8.25pc, furnishing & household equipment maintenance charges up by 7.89pc, Charges of utilities (housing, water, electricity, gas and fuel) increased by 6.10pc, Alcoholic beverages and Tobacco 5.86pc, recreation & culture 3.93pc, education 0.98pc and communication charges up by 0.29pc over corresponding month of last year. However, transportation charges declined by 1.53 pc over corresponding month of last year.

Price hike in almost all categories was more than previous month. However, the food was the showed highest increase that strongly jacked up the overall inflation.

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) on the other hand has increased by 1.05pc over August 2020 and 4.26 pc increase over corresponding month of last year. Keeping in view the low reading of the WPI, economic experts believe that CPI in coming months may reduce.

Since under the new methodology, the inflation is being gauged in urban and rural areas separately and then SBP reports the national inflation.

In September 2020, urban CPI inflation increased by 7.7pc as compared to an increase of 7.1pc in the previous month and 11.6pc in September 2019. On month-on-month basis, it increased by 1.3pc in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 0.8pc in the previous month and an increase of 0.7pc in September 2019.

Rural CPI inflation also increased by 11.1 pc on year-on-year basis in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 9.9pc in the previous month and 11.1pc in September 2019. On month-on-month basis, it increased by 2.0pc in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 0.4pc in the previous month and an increase of 0.8pc in September 2019.

During the month under review, core inflation (excluding food and energy costs) of urban CPI increased by 5.5 percent year on year basis as compared to increase of 5.6 percent in the previous month and 8.4 percent in September 2019. On month on month basis, it increased by 0.3pc in September 2020 as compared to increase of 0.7 percent in previous month and an increase of 0.4pc in corresponding month of last year.

Core inflation of rural CPI increased by 7.8pc on (YoY) basis in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 7.6pc in the previous month and 8.8pc in September 2019. Whereas, on month on month basis, it increased by 0.4 percent in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 0.8 percent in previous month, and an increase of 0.3 percent in corresponding month of last year.

SPI that gauges essential kitchen items prices on weekly basis, increased by 12pc year on year in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 11.7pc a month earlier and an increase of 14.7 percent in August 2019. On MoM basis, it increased by 2.1pc in September 2020 as compared to an increase of 0.9 percent a month earlier and an increase of 1.9 percent in July 2019.

Over the previous month, tomatoes price increased by 44 percent, Vegetables 30.3 percent, Chicken 18.3 percent, Onions 14.5 percent, Potatoes 6.2 percent, Eggs 5.2 percent, Pulse Gram 4.5 percent, Pulse Moong 3.5 percent, spices 3 percent, Pulse Mash 2.76 percent, Pulse Masoor 1.59 percent and milk fresh 1.16 percent.

"In 1996, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that Chernobyl was “the foremost nuclear catastrophe in human history”. In 2005, the IAEA and World Health Organisation (WHO) set out their united view: “The magnitude and scope of the disaster, the size of the affected population, and the long-term consequences make it, by far, the worst industrial disaster on record.

“Chernobyl unleashed a complex web of events and long-term difficulties, such as massive relocation, loss of economic stability, and long-term threats to health in current and, possibly, future generations.” In 2006, the independent TORCH (The Other Report on Chernobyl) report examined the health evidence. However thousands of scientific articles have been published since then.

These are discussed in a new TORCH-2016 report commissioned by Friends of the Earth Austria and funded by the City Government of Vienna. It clearly indicates that the adverse effects from Chernobyl are continuing. The accident had many consequences, including economic, ecological, social and political effects. TORCH-2016 focuses on the health effects, and clearly shows they were and are manifold, severe, widespread, and long-lasting.

The headline estimate of 40,000 future cancer deaths is derived from the collective dose estimate of 400,000 person sieverts by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) in 2011.

This figure is multiplied in TORCH-2016 by the currently accepted risk of fatal cancer from radiation (10 percent per person sievert) to arrive at an expected 40,000 fatal cancers in future. This is a valid routinely-used estimation method using the official linear no-threshold (LNT) model of radiation risks. The 40,000 figure is the same order of magnitude as other academic estimates.

The accident contaminated over 40 percent of Europe. The problem with nuclear power is that it can be supremely unforgiving: when things go wrong – as at Chernobyl (and Fukushima in 2011) – they can go very, very wrong indeed. Contaminating over 40 percent of Europe plus an estimated 40,000 deaths are pretty disastrous effects.

It is vital that governments learn from the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents. Many governments are phasing out their nuclear plants, but regrettably, a few governments – including the UK government and even that of Belarus, which suffered the brunt of Chernobyl’s fallout – have decided to ignore the lessons of Chernobyl and Fukushima and are planning or constructing more nuclear power stations.

In 2005, the IAEA/WHO stated: “What the Chernobyl disaster has clearly demonstrated is the central role of information and how it is communicated in the aftermath of radiation or toxicological incidents. Nuclear activities in Western countries have also tended to be shrouded in secrecy.

“The Chernobyl experience has raised the awareness among disaster planners and health authorities that the dissemination of timely and accurate information by trusted leaders is of the greatest importance.”

To re-establish that trust will be difficult. At a minimum, it will require the following steps. First, governments make it clear to their citizens that they will consider safer energy options that do not have the potential for another Chernobyl or Fukushima. Many such options exist.

Second, a dialogue to be set up between agencies such as IAEA, WHO and national governments on the one hand and various NGOs and health charities on the other for exchanges of views on radiation risks. Transparency is essential.

Third, WHO should no longer be required to have its reports on radiation matters vetted by the IAEA, as presently required under the 1959 agreement between the two UN agencies.

Fourth, UN agencies WHO, UNSCEAR, IAEA should be required to have independent scientists from NGOs and health charities as members of their main Committees. These agencies should also be required to consult on their draft reports, including the convening of meetings with environment NGOs and independent health charities.",neutral
"SUKKUR: An alarming 28 percent girls undergo child marriage before turning 18 and only one percent are allowed to choose a life partner, the National Commission on the Status of Women’s report stated.

The findings are part of a research report titled ‘Young Women in Pakistan: Status Report 2020’ released by the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW). The report seeks to address knowledge gaps by identifying needs, priorities and actions for empowerment of young women. The report didn’t mention about the sample size and methodology.

According to the report, more than one-fourth (28 percent) girls get married before turning 18. Another disturbing fact mentioned in the report says that 16 percent of the young women became mothers before 18 years. Regarding decision making and empowerment, the report said only 24 percent of the young women can take decisions about their education and employment. Sadly on marriage, only a whopping one percent girls get a chance to make decisions about choosing life partner, while only 16 percent girls were consulted by the family on this important issue, and for the rest the family’s decision is simply imposed.

The report also cites several other interesting factors. Around 48 percent of young women from 15-24 of age were not educated, employed or trained as compared to seven percent men. Regarding ownership of property, only less than two percent young women own physical assets, three percent owned agricultural land and two percent cent owned a house.

According to the report, the women cannot even decide about their own healthcare. Disturbingly, one-fourth young women need permission to seek healthcare. Only less than one-third can decide about purchasing food and clothing. As a positive factor, as many as 49 percent of every married employed women enjoy control over their earnings. However only 9 percent have a say in how the earning of the spouse is to be used.

Around 29 percent of the young women experience controlling behaviour by husbands. On wife battering, 44 percent of young married women and men do not consider it as a serious problem. Under this chapter, 15 percent youngsters experience physical violence.

As many as four percent suffer sexual non-spousal violence and similarly another four percent reported sexual spousal violence. Out of these victims, only 23 percent sought legal help while only 16 percent informed close friends or family members. Three percent of the victims informed the police, lawyers or sought assistance from other help mechanisms.",neutral
"SUKKUR: Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company – a joint venture between Engro and the provincial government – planned to double annual coal mining from Thar to 7.6 million tons that are expected to generate additional 660 megawatts till next year, its top official said on Friday.

Fazal Rizvi, chief executive officer of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company said the company is set to double the coal output from Thar block-II mine to 7.6 million tons per annum (mtpa) next year.

“The company has achieved the financial close of phase II during the year, which would allow the production output of the mine to increase from 3.8 mtpa to 7.6 mtpa, taking the total power generation from block-II to 1,320MW by 2021,” Rizvi said in a statement to mark a year of operations of Engro Powergen Thar (Private) Limited (EPTL).

SECMC unearthed the first layer of coal the Thar block in June 2018, completed all steady state production of on-specification coal and commenced commercial operation for 3.8 mtpa output of lignite coal under phase 1 of its plan in July last year.

EPTL was formed in 2014 to set up 330MW of two power projects in Thar. The company is a joint venture between Engro Powergen (with 50.1 percent ownership), China Machinery Engineering Corporation, Habib Bank, and Liberty Mills.

EPTL CEO Manzoor Hussain said the power plant continues to operate as per agreed protocols. “Given that this was the first year and for the first time that Thar coal was being used in the country to produce electricity, several teething issues were expected. However, the performance of the plant has been as per expectation with the plant ranking high in the merit order list of power plants, and also exhibiting high dispatch order.” Ghias Khan, president of Engro Corporation said the company is determined to solve some of Pakistan’s most pressing issues and resolving the challenges in the energy value chain.

“The success of Thar coal projects herald shared triumph for both the company and the country as this achievement translates into energy security for Pakistan.”",neutral
"Prisons and jails are amplifiers of infectious diseases and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic is no different.


According to a recent report of the commission constituted under the directions of the Islamabad High Court in Khadim Hussain vs Federation of Pakistan, there are over 77,000 inmates in Pakistan’s prisons, exceeding the authorized capacity by an alarming 36.4 percent. With the 23rd largest prison population in the world, it is no surprise that Pakistan’s prisons are incubators for the disease.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of Pakistan set aside the directions issued by the Islamabad High Court and the Sindh High Court for the release of accused persons and convicts to mitigate the spread of the virus in prisons and jails, consequently allowing release for only a limited category of prisoners.

Accused persons charged for offences under non-prohibitory clauses, vagrancy laws or offences carrying a sentence of less than three years could be considered for bail on personal bond subject to the following conditions: “(a) the benefit shall not extend in cases involving abuse / violent acts against women and children; (b) benefit shall first be extended to persons otherwise suffering from ailments or physical or mental disability; (c) benefit shall be extended to under trial prisoners [sic] who are 55 years of age or older and then other male under-trial prisoners [sic], provided there is no history of past convictions; (d) benefit shall be extended to all women / juvenile under trial prisoners [sic].”

Additionally, the following categories of convicted persons could be considered for release by the provincial governments under Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898: “(a) convicts who have otherwise completed their sentences but remain in jail on account of non-payment of fine / monetary penalty; (b) women / juvenile convicts who have completed 75% of their sentence and have no history of past convictions; (c) convicts whose remaining term in jail is six months or less provided offence was not violence against women or children; (d) women / juveniles who were sentenced to a term of one year or less.”

As the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic approaches its peak in Pakistan, efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus in prisons and jails in accordance with the order of the Supreme Court remain unsatisfactory. Last month, the Implementation Commission, constituted in the matter of Khadim Hussain vs Secretary Ministry of Human Rights, submitted its report to the Islamabad High Court on the measures adopted by prison authorities in light of the pandemic, according to which no prisoners had been released on bail in the provinces of Punjab, Balochistan and Sindh, whereas 3228 prisoners had been released in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

These statistics, or lack thereof, are a matter of grave concern; with rampant overcrowding, social distancing is near impossible for prisoners, effectively constituting an insurmountable obstacle to preventing and responding to Covid-19. This is further aggravated by the fact that as of January 2020, 2400 inmates across Pakistan were found to be suffering from contagious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, thereby increasing their vulnerability to coronavirus. What was already a bad situation has been made significantly worse by an unwillingness to decarcerate during the pandemic.

It is relevant to mention that during public health emergencies, the government of Pakistan is obligated under domestic and international law to protect the rights of prisoners, the most important being the right of life. This right is provided for not only in the constitution of Pakistan but also the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The government of Pakistan also has a duty to protect prisoners’ health and welfare, as provided under the Nelson Mandela Rules, the Prisons Act 1894 and the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978. These include the right to health services and right to contact with friends, family and lawyers. In light of the ongoing pandemic, it is therefore urgent that policymakers take the public health case for criminal justice reform seriously and make necessary changes to protect those in detention.

Multiple organisations and human rights defenders have suggested that the best way to control the virus in prisons is to dramatically decrease their population. The United Nation Office on Drugs and Crimes produced a set of recommendations in its advocacy brief titled ‘Covid-19 - Prisons and Pandemic: Inaction is not an option’ for addressing the challenge of an outbreak of Covid-19 in Balochistan’s prisons. These recommendations, although specific to the province of Balochistan, make the case for a mix of policy, judicial and other institutional measures in mitigating the risk of the virus in prisons and jails. In March, human rights organizations also issued a public statement, calling on federal and provincial governments to take urgent action to ensure the safety of inmates and staff in Pakistani prisons from the deadly virus.

While the adoption of sanitary measures and the provision of masks in prisons is a commendable step, the federal and provincial governments must do more to reduce prison populations in order to save lives and make their plans publicly available. Free Covid-19 testing of incarcerated persons and an official record of infected prisoners will also allow the state to adopt proportional measures.

As the pandemic continues to reshape the lives of all citizens in every corner in the world, no one is safe until everyone is safe, including those who are currently incarcerated. An effective response to prevent and mitigate the impact of Covid-19 in custodial settings is a pivotal component of the national response to this pandemic.",positive
"When it comes to economic policy in Pakistan, the refrain is ‘we must build our industry, we need more manufacturing!’

Just because Europe developed on manufacturing, and it was the early advice of development theory, most commentators still think manufacturing should be the foundation of our economy. The thought persists even though we are now living in a post-industrial digital age.

The vision gets even more bizarre when we go deeper into this idea. These commentators see us as perpetual followers, picking up crumbs from the feast of international trade that other countries are engaged in. Thus, one hears that China will move out of the light industry and we will relocate it to Pakistan. Will we always remain in the most basic of industries?

Then there is a view that we should export at the lowest possible margins while operating in the sector of commodity manufacturing. For example, we should make the cheapest possible textiles and sell them to Walmart for their cheapest possible line. This means that most of our manufacturers will work as a commodity producer at very cheap rates.

It seems we are still sitting in the era of early industrialization where manufacturing was owning machines and using labour to produce standardized products. Further development was an assembly line where again machines and cheap labour did the work but to produce standardized products. In both the models, the capitalist was merely making money on the ownership of machines.

The term ‘industrialist’ was therefore used for someone who owned machines. There was a romance associated with these absent landlords with machines and slave labour. But by the beginning of the 20th century and the rise of the corporation, and advanced marketing and management techniques, that model had become obsolete. Widely held companies like General Motors, Sears, General Electric and many others had already left the machine-owning capitalist of the 19th century way behind. Instead, modern production, product development and marketing were taking over under the guidance of a corporate elite.

In Pakistan, even today, a factory on acres of land set outside the city, devoid of product or brand development and any serious marketing is the norm. Spinning and early industrial activity remain a sign of a great ‘seth, and his power and prestige. So is a sugar mill, which is probably an early 19th-century industry.

We cherish these industrialists, often arguing for special privileges for them. The relationship of these industrialists and the government is very cosy. They offer much policy advice and are in constant contact with the power circles. In good times they keep all their profits and get tax exemptions; in bad times the government often subsidizes them. In other words, they have a government guarantee to win all the time.

The ‘seth’ with the machines’ model was obsolete in the late 19th century when companies started growing rapidly to develop a diverse product base and global reach. A professionally run firm with innovation, and research and development was strongly in place in the post-depression economy. At this time a host of new firms – franchising, pharmaceuticals, early computing and semiconductors – were regularly appearing.

At no time did these companies have a guarantee from the government to keep all profits and pass on the losses. For each successful company, many companies went out of business and declared bankruptcy and lost their capital. Competition and survival of the fittest prevailed.

These growing companies established local and global value chains. They established a complex business environment through innovation and entrepreneurship, all without government involvement.

The model of ‘seth with machines and state guarantees and protection’ never prevailed in Western countries. Manufacturing was momentarily important but never the desirable end of the policy. It happened as a part of technological development. It was soon overtaken by human ingenuity and innovation for product and market development to meet the myriad human needs.

In Pakistan, we are still stuck with the model of ‘seth with machines and state guarantees and protection’. This archaic model has hindered in producing large corporates with a diversified ownership, strong product base, research and development, professional corporate culture and a global presence.

The world has now gone digital and extremely mobile. Note that in the list of the world’s largest companies (see below) there is no manufacturing company and no ‘seth with machines and state guarantees and protection’. Apple and Microsoft both are not manufacturing companies but have physical products mostly produced through outsourcing in poor countries.

What is common among these companies is innovation, design and consistent pressure to improve in every way. In short, growth companies are R&D companies. From Amazon to Berkshire Hathaway, R&D and alacrity are important. There is no ‘seth with machines and state guarantees and protection’ in any of these companies. Nor do we hear of government guarantees or subsidies and bailouts like in Pakistan. Nor is there a frenzy to buy machines at a subsidy. Nor are they agitated by export orders or seeking protection.

Most important of all, the world’s largest and most successful companies are fully geared to meet consumer needs and continuously anticipate consumer demands. They are not randomly producing low-value products through an absentee mechanism for a distant buyer.

Pakistani policy needs to wake up to the reality of the growing world and reject the defunct model of the ‘seth with machines and state guarantees and protection’. We need more consumer and R&D-focused, and professionally run innovative companies that think beyond machines, protection and low valued products.",positive
"According to the New York Times on Monday, the number of troops in Afghanistan would be halved from its current level of 4,500.

The legacy of the war in Afghanistan for Americans and for Afghans is somewhere between dismal and horrifying. Over 2,300 US military personnel and at least 65,000 Afghan soldiers and police have been killed. As of 2019, the death toll for Afghan civilians was approximately 43,074 and 2020 is on track to add 3,000 more. From 2001 to 2015, there were 833 major limb amputations of US military personnel serving in Afghanistan. Suicide rates among modern veterans is nothing short of a public health emergency. Despite this massive sacrifice, around 40 percent of Afghan territory remains contested or completely under Taliban control. The 2014 presidential election was contested and required US-led and UN-backed mediation that only put a temporary bandage on a deeply dysfunctional system. The 2019 elections again required a political settlement negotiated behind closed doors. Corruption is so endemic in the Afghan government that the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found $19 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse in the last decade alone. Afghanistan remains the world’s number one producer of opium which is turned into heroin.

Even as the dysfunction that has characterized the war is widely recognized, few in the foreign policy establishment are willing to consider the possibility that its continuation no longer serves the interests of the United States. Indeed, rumors that the outgoing Trump administration might pull the plug on the war evoke a panicky response. A group of Obama and Bush era diplomats recently warned that such a withdrawal is an “impetuous, damaging, and risky course of action.” To them, a hasty withdrawal from a war that has cost the American people $778 Billion, over 2,000 lives, and reputational damage from an era of torture and strategic impotence will lead those who wish the US harm to “toast with champagne or tea”. Even as our coalition partners have largely watched from the sidelines since 2014, these former diplomats worry that a quick exit may prevent allies from joining future security efforts.

Granted, the Trump administration’s withdrawal plan is less a plan than an aspiration. The logistical challenges in pulling out the remainder of US forces by year’s end are daunting. But the only alternative offered by critics is to indefinitely hold our troops hostage to the outcome of a “peace agreement” that Washington cannot control. This replaces the unattainable objective of militarily defeating the Taliban with an equally evasive goal of a perfect peace deal in a country with complex ethnic, religious, and tribal cleavages. It is a prescription for remaining in Afghanistan forever.

In a letter published last year, some of the same former diplomats advocated against a date for a US withdrawal, explaining that “[a] fundamental mistake of the Obama administration was the constant repetition of dates for departure.” Ever-changing and dubiously credible withdrawal announcements aside, this assessment ignores the Obama administration’s three-year long surge which saw as many as 100,000 U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan, leaving 1,044 killed in action, 13,622 injured, and 8,693 Afghan civilians killed in the crossfire. A web of forward operating bases and combat outposts created the illusion of coalition control over large swaths of Afghanistan, but as soon the surge ended, the Taliban took back these gains. The obvious question is: When is enough, enough?

"Recently, the UAE has announced that outstanding professionals and students with brilliant academic record are eligible to apply for its 10-year golden residency visa.

His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, vice-president and prime minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, in his tweet, expressed that the golden visa advantage also extends to spouses and children. ""We are keen to embrace talent that drives future development and this is only the beginning,"" he stated.

The UAE came into existence 24 years after the independence of Pakistan. The Emirates Airlines was founded with the professional support of Pakistani pilots and aviation experts, who were once employees of our national airline PIA. Pakistani labourers also played a pivotal role in the construction of the world's best infrastructure that includes multi-storey buildings and network of roads connecting Dubai, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi and other Emirati states.

Historically, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, founding father of the UAE and first president of the country, laid the foundation of the UAE in 1971 while keeping a modern lifestyle in mind. The great Sheikh Zayed wanted to transform his country into the most favourite destination for all nationalities by eliminating all kinds of discrimination and biases.

Today, the UAE is known as the region's most stable economic power due to its attractive foreign investment policies, best career opportunities and impressive lifestyle. However, in my view, its main strength is the state’s policy to promote a culture of tolerance, brotherhood and endurance. The UAE is the only country to have a formal Ministry of Tolerance. Different positive social initiatives are being taken under the said ministry. The UAE declared 2019 as the Year of Tolerance. I was invited as a special guest, on the occasion of the World Tolerance Summit, to represent Pakistan and to express my views on the role of the media for promoting tolerance and endurance in modern society.

The way in which the UAE’s top leadership hosted international delegates during the World Tolerance Summit last year made it clear that the present leadership is very committed to move forward the peace-loving vision of founding father late Sheikh Zayed.

Keeping the national interests on top priority, the government believes that avoiding confrontation and tussle with regional players is in the best interest of the people of the UAE. Recently, the UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Qarqash also made clear that although the UAE does not agree with foreign policies of some Muslim countries still his country does not seek conflict with them.

Constructing an interfaith compound to promote religious harmony among people having different faiths is yet another achievement. Worship places of different religions like mosques, churches and synagogues are being built together. Similarly, in order to acknowledge the services of the Hindu community, a temple was constructed at Abu Dhabi with seven pillars representing the seven states of the UAE.

The UAE is also the first Arab country to send a space mission to Mars. There will be celebrations of the 50th anniversary in February 2021 at the time of landing the Emirati spacecraft at Mars. Similarly, the contributions of the UAE military, along with Nato, in ensuring the peace process in Afghanistan are also remarkable.

In my view, the UAE government’s policies are a role model for all such countries that want to achieve development and prosperity. Being a patriotic citizen, it is also a matter of great concern that the countries that got independence after us are moving forward in the right direction.

The UAE is rapidly transforming itself into a land of opportunities whereas we prefer to indulge ourselves in leg pulling, mudslinging and character assassination of others. It is the need of the time that we must focus on promoting tolerance and endurance in our beloved motherland.

"The recent provocative statements of French President Macron and other French officials have once again created an impression among many Muslims that the West is against the second largest religion on the earth, triggering demonstrations across the Muslim world and sporadic attacks in Austria, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere.

The situation prompted Pakistan and some other Muslim countries to take up the case of Islamophobia before an international audience that does not seem to comprehend the roots of Muslim anger towards the West.

Ties between Muslims and Christians were cordial during the early centuries of Islam, turning sour with the eruption of crusades and worsening during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The colonization of Muslim states and the creation of Israel created hatred in the hearts of Muslims. The threat of communism forced Muslims and the West to fight this ‘red monster’ collectively, with Washington and London urging Muslims to wage a jihad against the ‘red infidels’.

The demise of the USSR emboldened the jihadis, who blamed the West for the genocide of Muslims in Bosnia, persecution of the faithful in Chechnya, the oppression of Kashmiris by India, and the subjugation of Palestinians by Israel. Islamists exploited the situation stoking anti-West feelings across the Muslim world but unfortunately, the Western media described these extreme Islamists as the representatives of all Muslims, unleashing lethal propaganda against the faith. The economic crisis in the West provided an opportunity for far-right forces to blame Muslims for the economic hardships, which resulted in violence against Muslims as well. Muslim extremists also targeted ordinary civilians in the UK, France, Germany, and several other countries. All this created the impression that Muslims are intolerant people. The images of Muslim radicals in Western media fanned anti-Islam feelings.

Various public opinion and surveys also reflect this anti-Islam bias. According to a Gallup survey of 2016, “Fifty-two percent of Americans and 48 percent of Canadians agree that the West does not respect Muslim societies. Among all the different religious population in the US, about one-half of them have some kind of prejudice towards Muslim Americans. The alarming section of the survey was that about 1/3 of those who have no prejudice towards Muslims had unfavorable opinions about Islam.”

Muslims living in Western societies view this with concern. During the same survey, eight in 10 Muslims had views that Western societies should abstain from discrediting the Quran and Islam overall and 6 in 10 believed that the West should not discriminate and portray them as hostiles because about 48 percent of the American Muslim population experienced racial or religious discrimination. Muslims assert that it is not only Muslim extremists who are using Islam to carry out attacks but white supremacists are also indulging in such activities using a different ideology – but they are never called Christian extremists. This assertion seems to carry some weight..

Unfortunately, these anti-Muslim feelings are not confined to a few semi-literate Trump’s supporters or far-right political workers. Some leaders in the Western world are also resorting to Islamophobia to boost their support. For instance, French President Macron recently stated that Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world. This statement could have been tolerated but the outrageous action of displaying the caricatures of the Prophet (pbuh) could not have been ignored. The action infuriated millions of Muslims, lending credence to the narrative of the extremists that the West is against Islam and has been waging a crusade against Muslims.

The West should realize that it is Muslims that are the biggest target of militants’ attacks. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a US think tank, among the total global terrorist attacks, about 85 percent of them occurred in Islamic countries, and 73 percent of them were carried out in the Middle East, North Africa, and other Muslim states. ISIS, which is believed to have the support of Western powers, is responsible for 37 percent of attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. According to the same report, the number of deaths in Muslim countries from terrorism was 43 percent higher than that of the US and Europe. Around 90 percent of the human cost in seven of the ten countries most affected by terrorism were Muslim states.

The West needs to realize that terrorism has no religion. Robert Pape, the author of ‘Dying to Win’, concluded that half of the suicide attacks between 1980 and 2003 were carried out by secularists in response to some kind of military occupation.

Most Muslims do not subscribe to the ideas of extremists. According to research from the University of Maryland, 77 percent of the Arab population believes in the democratic system of government, and only 34 percent in the Shariah system of government. So those Muslims who talk about a rigid interpretation of Shariah, vowing to impose it on the Western world constitute a tiny minority among the 1.8 billion Muslims.

The West should avoid fanning anti-Muslim feelings based on their ideology. This could be one of the best ways to battle not only Islamophobia but far-right extremism as well.

"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Thursday declared the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 2019 illegal and unconstitutional and directed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police chief to take control of internment centres in which hundreds of terror suspects have been languishing since years.


A division bench comprising Chief Justice Waqar Ahmad Seth and Justice Musarrat Hilali also directed the Inspector General of Police to form a scrutiny committee within three days and review the charges against the internees charged in terrorism cases and languishing there since years without trials.

The court ordered that if the internees are found involved in the terrorist activities, then they be tried by the proper courts and those found innocent by the scrutiny committee should be released.

The court declared the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 2019 as void. The writ petition was filed against the promulgation of the ordinance through which the powers earlier assigned to the armed forces in erstwhile Fata and Pata have now been extended to the entire province.

The court declared as illegal and unconstitutional the two Acts of the KP Assembly, passed for Continuation of Laws in Erstwhile Pata Act, 2018, and KP Continuation of Laws in Erstwhile Fata Act, 2019, which had been challenged in the high court.

During the hearing, Shabir Hussain Gigyani submitted before the court that first, the KP government was not competent to pass an act for the continuation of the law, which is already repealed as Article 247 of Constitution and was omitted.

The petitioner Shabir Hussain Gigyani advocate argued that he has also challenged the recently promulgated ordinance, which was promulgated to defeat the writ petition in the court. The petitioner submitted that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has promulgated an ordinance extending certain powers of the armed forces, which were available in the erstwhile Fata and Pata while acting in aid of civil power, to the entire province.

Gigyani stated that the KP Actions (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 2019, which was issued by the governor on August 5, is almost a reproduction of two regulations promulgated by the president in 2011 for Fata and Pata, through which legal cover was given to several detention centres set up during the military operations in different regions.

He argued that through the recent laws, the KP government enacted two laws - KP Continuation of Laws in Erstwhile Pata Act, 2018, and KP Continuation of Laws in Erstwhile Fata Act, 2019 – which were only to empower the armed forces to take actions only in the former Fata and Pata and legal cover to internment centers, but now the KP government through this ordinance has empowered the armed forces to take actions against the citizens in the whole of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

He said the ordinance assigns wide-ranging powers to the authorised officers and armed forces besides giving an interning authority to detain a suspect until the continuation of action in aid of civil power by the armed forces.

As per the ordinance, the armed forces have also been empowered to occupy any property with the approval of the provincial government.

Advocate General KP, Shumail Ahmad Butt and Additional Attorney General Qazi Babar Arshad submitted that promulgation of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Action (in Aid of Civil Power) Ordinance, 2019 on August 5 was needed and had the proper procedure and the high court has no jurisdiction to hear the petition challenging the ordinance.",positive
"Glowing and affectionate tributes were heaped on the late journalist Idrees Bakhtiar at an event held at the Arts Council on Saturday evening. Bakhtiar had passed away on May 29.


The Arts Council hall was packed to capacity which bore testimony to the late journalist’s popularity and his invaluable contribution to journalism.

Television personality Athar Vaqar Azeem, the first speaker of the evening, had a whole lot of nice things to say about the departed. “He was a complete journalist,” he said. He thoroughly praised Bakhtiar’s professional capability.

Journalist Mujahid Barelvi said, “Idrees was a bridge between the Left and the Right. His reporting was the most objective and never reflected any ideological inclination.”

Mrs Jafri, a former neighbour of Bakhtiar in Hyderabad, mostly recalled her and her families’ ties with the late journalist and described what a wonderful human being he was – loving, sincere and always ready to go out of his way to help others. Talking of his demise, she said she felt that she had been deprived of the most loving elder brother.

Shahabuddin Bakhtiar, Idrees Bakhtiar’s grandson, said they were having a hard time coming to the realisation that his grandfather was not there anymore.

Wasi Zaidi described his association with the departed. He recalled the days in Hyderabad when he, Bakhtiar and some other friends used to frequent coffee houses and restaurants to have intellectual discussions.

Zaidi said he had never seen Bakhtiar in a bad temper. He said despite being a rightist, he always served as a bridge between the Right and the Left.

Dr Qaiser Sajjad, terming Bakhtiar’s death an inalienable loss to journalism and society, said the most redeeming feature about the deceased’s nature was that he always controlled his temper. The speaker added that another virtue of Bakhtiar was that he never indulged in backbiting or discrediting others in their absence.

Journalist Mazhar Abbas was candid enough to admit that the two of them never agreed with each other on the matters of ideology. He, however, showered praises on Bakhtiar for his professional ethics.

Bakhtiar’s stories were never contradicted, Abbas said. He recalled the Pan Am Boeing 747 hijacking incident in Karachi in September 1986 and informed the event how Bakhtiar, despite the paucity of time, rushed to the airport and dug out a detailed story promptly. He referred to Bakhtiar as a complete journalist.

Like so many of the speakers before and after him, Nehal Hashmi said Bakhtiar never flew into a rage. He was the calmest and most good-tempered person one would ever come across, he said.

Journalist Pirzada Salman said the first time he met Bakhtiar was in London where they both were staying at the place of a common friend. “He was one of the counted few who always most generously appreciated his peers’ or his colleagues’ professional performance. This, Salman said, was a quality which was very, very rare among people as they were always reluctant to openly admit the professional performance of their co-workers.

Other speakers like Nazir Leghari and Anwar Ahmed Zai also narrated their experiences with the deceased and heaped all praise on him.

Arts Council’s Ahmed Shah also spoke on the occasion and said Bakhtiar was as wonderful a human being as he was as a journalist. He said the late journalist just never let his reports be tainted with ideological inclinations and was just the most professional reporter.",positive
"The city’s Canvas Art Gallery was host to a unique art exhibition on Tuesday afternoon. Based on the collection of Rehana and Shakil Saigol, the show featured the works of many artists who are not in our midst anymore and whose works catapulted viewers into another era and another school of art.

Notable among these were works by Anna Molka Ahmed, whose works are still considered masterpieces despite the pursuit having undergone so many changes, changes that have turned the sublime pursuit of art into a brain-racking brainteaser.

Once a household name in the field of art in the country, she is today a part of the past, but such achievers live on through the contributions they may have made to sublime fields. Two of the works adorning the walls of the art gallery are portraits by Ahmed which quickly remind the viewer of art as it was in her era. The two works are the portraits of a man and a woman. They are 20x25 inches pastel on paper. They are just portraits but portraits that speak.

Ahmed has so masterfully captured the expressions in their eyes in the most profound of manner. Their eyes have a story to tell. The colouring is so simple and true to life, no flamboyant colour combinations that artists nowadays have a propensity to.

Painted as way back as 1973, the works acquaint the viewer with trends in art as it was four decades ago. Then, there are works by another artist who slipped into the past just a couple of weeks ago, Jamil Naqsh. His works, titled, “Pigeons”, are an endearing depiction of all the things that adorn nature and is reflected through animal and bird life. Titled, “Pigeons”, the works are an endearing representation of nature through bird life. They show pigeons huddled together. Then, there’s a work by Mohammad Ali titled Usama Bin Laden. It depicts Usama with nothing more than a loin cloth and an expression of despondency in his eyes.

In all there are 27 works adorning the walls of the art gallery. There are two by artist Zulqarnain Haider. They are both landscapes. Haider is a lyrical colourist indeed. One of these, titled laburnum, depicts a laburnum tree with its thick colured foliage. It is semi-impressionistic in style.

The other one shows a body of clear sapphire water interspersed with an equal amount of land. These indeed are eye-catching collections. Both works are 18 inches by 14 inches oil-on-board.

There are also two works by Naiza Khan, which are sketches of the female anatomy. The exhibition, curated by Dawn Group CEO Hameed Haroon and based on the personal collection of Rehana and Shakil Saigol, goes on up until June 27.",positive
"The above could be considered a befitting heading to the exhibition, titled, The Grid, a digital art show that opened at the Full Circle Art Gallery on Friday evening.


The 29 artworks adorning the gallery’s walls could have been said to depict anything from aesthetics to horror.

The paintings by Adnan Ali, Amara Sikander, Fatima Baig, Maryam Jajja, Mahoor Jamal and Sara Bokhari represented a wide array of artistic talent, from the aesthetically pleasant to the weird.

Among the artists, Adnan Ali seems to have a propensity to the horrifying. Four of his works are meant to scare the life out of anybody, especially the ones titled ‘Bloodbath’ and ‘Infected’.

Bloodbath is a scary representation of a monstrous figure. One wonders if that is the purpose of art, to scare the viewer into nightmares.

Ali, who is an art director, says, “I am not an art graduate and my journey did not start with an institute. It was my sheer dedication towards my passion that I made it so far.”

Fatima Baig on the other hand is highly artistic. Her artworks are pleasantly alluring. Her work, Dream Children, is a beautiful representation of the innocence of childhood and how children find pleasure in everything. It shows a little child clutching on to an orb and smiling away, with eyes shut. It is a reminder of how beautiful childhood can be.

Then there’s another one of her works, Ask The Moon, which shows a lovely young girl tightly holding on to the full moon.

What was highly commendable about the exhibition was that despite it being a digital art show, it was free of all ‘isms’, cubism, abstractism, and all other jargons of modern art, which specializes in representation of themes through straight lines or sketches which are brain teasers and make the viewer guess as to what it could be all about.

Maryam Jajja is a Pakistani designer and an illustrator currently pursuing a Masters in Berlin.

She has a keen eye for branding, storytelling and visual narratives revolving around Pakistan.

Her work titled, Being, is a profound representation of a female figure n a very contemplative posture. It is as if she (the figure) is contemplating the purpose of her existence.

The exhibition, which lasts up until June 28, is a must-visit for those inclined to the current trend called digital art and also the various, conflicting styles in art. It is an interesting exhibition, indeed.",positive
"The 8th UBL (United Bank Ltd) Literary Awards presentation ceremony was held at a local hotel on Saturday evening. The event was meant to recognise and celebrate the contribution of a host of Pakistani writers, poets and authors in the realm of literature.

The function was attended by a host of luminaries in the field and the media. There were over 130 entries that were shortlisted by a panel of judges that included Dr Asghar Nadeem Syed, Dr Asif Aslam Farrukhi, columnist Ghazi Salahuddin, Dr Arifa Syeda, Kishwar Naheed, Dr Anwaar Ahmed and Masood Ashar.

In Urdu fiction, Akhtar Raza Salimi was declared the winner for his ‘Jindar’. In Urdu non-fiction, Dr Nasir Abbas Nayyar won the award for his ‘Us ko aik shakhs samajhna to munasib naheen’.

Munawwar Husain was recognised for his best translation into Urdu, titled ‘Dur uftada shehr se aik taveel nazm’. In children’s Urdu literature, Shanul Haq Haqqi was declared the winner for his ‘Nazmein, pahelian aur nasr paray’. In children’s English literature, Amina Azfar won for her work titled ‘Partition’. Author and poet Zehra Nigah was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award. In English non-fiction, Tariq Khosa was recognised for his ‘The Faltering State’. The awards of Shanul Haq Haqqi and Fahmida Riaz were received by Haqqi’s grandson Faizan Haqqi and by Fahmida Riaz’s daughter respectively.

Welcoming the guests earlier, UBL President & CEO Sima Kamil said: “It is really refreshing to be here. Bankers are usually said to be boring people. We have had people who think and who write. Future generations don’t have the time to think. We should begin to involve the youth in such literary and creative pursuits.”

She added: “Pakistan is a wonderful mix of cultures, languages and ethnicities, and our literary heritage is proof enough. The UBL realises its responsibility to recognise and inspire writers, and to continue contributing to the country’s literary scenario. Let us hope that this literary impetus does not slacken and that future generations will fully utilise these literary treasures.”

This was followed by a performance of Ghazals by noted vocalist Salman Alvi, including two by the revolutionary people’s poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz: ‘Ai jazba-e-dil gar main chahoon’ and ‘Hum dekhein ge’. Alvi drew hearty applause.",positive
"A highly enlightening and informative exhibition on the refugee phenomenon opened at the Commune Artist Colony on Saturday afternoon. The exhibition titled ‘Arrival City’ was held under the joint auspices of the Goethe-Institut and Marvi Mazhar & Associates.

The pictorial exhibition traces the phenomenon and the circumstances that cause the influx of refugees, the pushes and pulls that cause conflicting feelings among them as regards their identity and cultural heritage, their welcome by the host societies, the differences about their identity that arise between them and their future generations, their economic opportunities, and the availability of urban spaces to them.

The exhibition had as its theme the presence of Afghan refugees in the country who flooded Pakistan after the Soviet entry there towards the fag end of the 1970s decade, something audaciously referred to by the West as the “Soviet invasion”, little realising (or knowing) that the Soviet troops came after the joint decision of the Afghan government, headed by Hafeezullah Amin, and the Soviets under Article 4 of the Afghan-Soviet Friendship Treaty of 1921.

There were transparencies and videos of the Afghan settlements spread out all over Karachi. The videos showed interviews and profiles of various Afghans in town and the conflicting feelings they had about their stay in Pakistan which, for all practical purposes, has assumed a permanent nature.

Despite having stayed here for decades now, many are shown pining for their homeland and dream of returning, while others recount the problems they come across in an alien environment. There are still others who seem content to have reconciled themselves in a new home and a new environment.

This is precisely what Peter Cachola Schmal, director of the German Museum of Architecture in Frankfurt, Germany, had to comment while talking to The News.

He said that there were cases where immigrants had come from the same country but from different places within the same country, while there were other cases where immigrants had come from the same village, like the Bangladeshi diaspora in Southall, London. He added that they are helped into settling down economically by the kindred feeling of their fellow immigrants.

The immigrants may have resolutely decided to return to their country of origin, but their second generation, who has been born and bred in that alien set-up, assimilate the features of the host society, while the third generation may not even think of returning, as the land of their forefathers has become totally foreign to them.

He agreed that tensions between these immigrants and the host society did occur, and said that while nobody expected the immigrants to give up their cultural mores, it was also incumbent on the immigrants to assimilate in that society by taking up the host societies’ ways.

Speaking of the racial phenomenon, he said that over due course of time, immigrants could easily become fully assimilated in the host society, and cited his own example, saying that while his father was German, his mother was Filipino.

There were photographs depicting the rebirth of the German city of Frankfurt after the Second World War, and how the city was planned and rebuilt to accommodate the immigrants who were flooding it from war-torn Europe.

Earlier, Marvi Mazhar of Marvi Mazhar & Associates welcomed the guests and talked of the relevance of the exhibition, followed by Stephen Winkler, director of the Goethe-Institut, Peter Cachola Schmal and Yousuf Bashir.",positive
"A dire shortage of machinery to implement relevant laws is the main cause of the rapid spread of the smoking addiction among the youth.

This was stated by Dr Nayyar Abdur Rehman of the Karachi Psychiatric Hospital while addressing a press conference on the occasion of the WHO-designated No Tobacco Day at the Karachi Press Club on Friday afternoon.

The consumption of tobacco and allied products like gutka and sheesha are all very harmful to human health and well-being. With the help of statistics, Dr Rehman said 1.2 billion people across the globe were slave to this habit and wasted away the equivalent of Rs50 billion on this harmful pastime.

He said that around 100,000 people were falling victim to the causes of smoking, including death. He said smoking “sheesha” for an hour was just like smoking a hundred cigarettes successively.

He said there was a law that stipulated that there could be no cigarette selling shop or cabin within 500 yards of a school or college campus, yet there was a profusion of them, exposing young people to the temptation. “Sheesha” sellers, in particular, he said, were targeting young boys and girls.

Dr Akhtar Farid Siddiqui of the same hospital said that smoking affected every organ most profusely. He said that these tobacco-related products, including cigarette smoking, were responsible for diseases like lung cancer, tuberculosis, heart attacks and high blood pressure.

Dr Salahuddin Siddiqui of the same hospital said society at large had a major role to play to increase awareness of the lethal effects of smoking and other kinds of addiction to tobacco-related products. All three speakers agreed that a major step forward would be to curtail demand for these products which, in turn, would stall supply.

Dr Rehman remarked that unfortunately, the smoking habit was gaining momentum among women in both the rural areas and the urban elite. He said that smoking among pregnant women caused serious complications which did affect not only them but their foetuses too.

Dr Rehman said the massive amount that cumulatively was wasted away in smoking could be much better utilised by spending on social welfare to alleviate the sufferings of the less privileged and eliminating other scars from society. He said there were some drugs that could help one kick this habit. Two of the drugs he named were Nortyptiline and Bupropion. He said that these drugs were available at their hospital.

To a question as to why the government allowed or encouraged for multinationals producing tobacco-related products, Dr Farid Siddiqui said that it was a way to generate revenues for the state as the multinationals were very good taxpayers and did not indulge in concealment or evasion. However, he said that checks should be imposed on them to control the menace.",positive
"Big brother is finally watching you (us) in real time. And because we’re not used to it, we’re going about our daily commute, unawares. However, all our tiny transgressions – of red lights, and lanes and what not – are being recorded. And soon enough, we get a nice little fine notice in the mail, complete with a few coloured pictures of the actual incident taking place, so that there is no room for confusion.

There are numerous issues directly related to these cameras and the auto-ticketing system which has been enforced on us. What if the car doesn’t have a camera readable number plate? Sure, there was a time when the excise and taxation teams were out in full force, breaking those fancy number plates and forcing owners to get the machine readable ones, but all that’s fizzled out innit, and all those personalised plates are back on the streets. Or, how about the fact that a car’s been sold to a new buyer, but the database hasn’t been updated? You get the idea. However, this piece isn’t about the shortcomings of this system.

It’s about the person driving the vehicle and who commits the transgressions which are now being caught on camera. It’s about what the person does before s/he even reaches the signal, to commit his or her crime.

How many times have you seen this happen on the roads: there you are, driving in your lane. There’s some reasonable traffic on the road, when suddenly you see a little space open up, on the left. You immediately check the mirrors, and leave your lane, and move into this left one. However, in that lane, there was a car that had also noticed the space and had sped up to take it as well. As you move and so does the other one, another car, right behind you sees you leaving, and decides to move in also. All hell breaks loose. Sometimes you make it into the lane, and sometimes you don’t. But the general flow of the road has been destroyed. Or how about the guy who’s been driving in the left lane all this while and only when he approaches the signal does he start blinking right and just goes for the kill. And you just sit there and wonder, what?

There are numerous other examples which we all go through every day. Overtaking from the left. Tailgating. Driving too fast or two slow in the wrong lane. You get the idea. All these actions combine to make driving in Lahore a harrowing, near-death experience. And none of these is a fineable offence. So far, anyway. But before we get to that, where have all these habits come from anyway? You’re thinking, it was probably the driving school’s fault; we should fine them to the high heavens!

But does anyone have a handle on the number of people who have learnt to drive through these driving schools? I’m willing to bet top money that most, upwards of 90 percent of drivers in Pakistan, have learnt from a family elder, or a cousin or a friend. And all that was taught really was: this is how you turn the car on, this is how you shift gears (don’t even need that now) and this is how you break. The rest you can figure out on your own. And that’s what most people do: figure it out every time they get on the road.

So okay, you learnt from your cousin Faisal and now you’re on the road. What about the licence? How did this donkey of a driver manage to pass the driving test anyway? (For those who haven’t seen it, our local driving test is designed to make everyone fail and has absolutely no link with how real driving happens – but again, that’s a conversation for another time)

The truth is, he didn’t pass the driving test, but managed to get the licence anyway. Each man has his price Zeeshan, and yours was pretty low. Things admittedly are better now than they were, but still, there is a huge number of drivers on the road who have managed to get their licences without passing the test.

As a start, the traffic department needs to start a large-scale media campaign designed to address these problems – much like it did with the seat belts. Our drivers don’t know any better because nobody told them. So let’s start with the basics. Speed limit. Distance from other vehicles. Lane discipline. Turning and overtaking etiquettes.

Make video animations for social media and TV. Posters for newspapers and billboards. Get local radio channels to run public service announcements. After sensitising the public, we move on to the next stage. Severe fines. History has proven, on so many occasions, that the best way to stop the incidence of a crime is to make its punishment severely outweigh the action. So if you find someone over-speeding, make him or her pay heavily, maybe more so than breaking a signal. In fact, if a car over-speeds to break a light, it should be fined twice. The financial pinch of the tickets, and the time lost in paying them and going to collect your ID will do wonders in ensuring that at least that driver doesn’t make the mistake again.

And if you’re able to sensitise all these drivers, what will we do about the jaywalkers – who are willing to risk life and limb by crossing a busy street when there is a pathway (over or under) made especially for them 100 metres away? Jaywalking is, as it should be, a crime in some countries. Singapore, for example, levies a fine of S$20 for a first offence, but repeat offenders can be fined nearly S$1000, along with a jail term. However, unlike Singapore, most countries that do have a jaywalking law rarely enforce it.

Till all this happens, Lahore’s traffic mess will remain as is, regardless of the number of cameras installed and e-challans administered.",positive
"A solitary kite was flying over a busy neighbourhood. It wasn’t a fancy gudda or patang, but a homemade kite that is put together with a plastic bag and a few sticks from a broom.

On a sunny and cold winter’s morning, the kite fluttered above the low-rise houses, not just as a sign of protest but a stark reminder of what once was. My son caught me staring at the kite and asked: “Can you teach me how to fly a kite, Abba?” And as my hands came together, with the thumbs in line, I replied: “I’m not sure I remember myself, son”.

As spring approaches, the longing for Basant has surged. The chatter has already started on social media. But the question remains the same: will kite-flying ever be reinstated? Last February, the Punjab chief minister put the matter to rest unequivocally by stating that “there is a complete ban on Basant”.

Given the quicksand that the ruling PML-N finds itself in at the moment, Basant might not be high on its agenda. However, some might argue that this may be the best time to reopen the conversation surrounding Basant. This is because Basant remains a not-so-distant memory for anyone who grew up in Lahore and its surrounding areas in the 1980s and 1990s.

What was the problem with Basant, anyway? Was it the chemical or glass-laced string that slit people’s throats or the aerial firing which took innocent lives? Probably both. There were other problems as well: electrocution; tripping electricity lines; overexcited people falling from rooftops; and traffic concerns. All of these issues added up and the PML-N government did what it always does: it decided to shut down the circus altogether when, in fact, it could have earned some valuable political points by embracing Basant on its own terms.

If Basant is to be brought back, efforts need to be made to put an end to aerial firing, the use of deadly strings and the traffic jams. This basically means that kite-flying cannot be carried out in residential areas within the city.

So, the authorities should take Basant out of town – so far out that the loose strings no longer pose a threat. There is ample room outside the city where land can be designated for kite-flying and people can rent land from the authorities for this purpose.

But they cannot bring their own strings. The government will need to designate a handful of suppliers who will manufacture the strings according to strict procedures and ensure that there is no chemical and/or glass coating. The government can go a step further and regularise kite manufacturers as well. This will ensure that the string and kite are purchased from government-approved vendors.

In addition, it could provide a source of revenue for the provincial government and, of course, the cottage industry as well. These efforts should coincide with a major crackdown on illegal vendors to compel residents to purchase strings and kites from government-approved sellers. Since the land where the festival is held will be under government control, stringent security measures should be put in place to ensure that no firearms are brought in either. To make sure that the festival has a sufficiently large turnout to make it a success, the government can run special buses that take people from town centres to the venue.

In order to further entice residents to embrace Basant 2.0, the government should create partnerships with food festivals such as the Lahore Eat Festival so that there is an assortment of food stalls at the venue. A stage should be set up and popular artists should be invited to perform throughout the festival.

Critics will argue that this form of ‘controlled festival’ is contrary to what Basant is about. But, to be honest, it seems like a good alternative. Would you rather not fly a kite at all?

On the government’s side, there is a great deal of goodwill to be gained. With the election season around the corner, this goodwill could translate into votes. It’s also entirely possible that in the first year, the festival may not attract the response that a Basant event should. But if the powers that be persevere, then it’s possible that the festival will catch on in two or three years.

Basant and the festivities that are associated with it were once a major tourist magnet. While backpackers and mountaineers are arriving in large numbers in the country’s northern areas, the number of cultural tourists remains paltry. Given that the security situation has visibly improved, isn’t now the right time to find a solution to kite-flying? After all, for a large number of people, the chief minister is the man who took away the kites. Wouldn’t he prefer to be remembered as the man who brought them back?",positive
"Pakistan has a brand new counter-terrorism force (CTF). The first batch of nearly 500 corporals, as they have been named, has recently graduated from an intensive course on investigation, intelligence and special operations. The trainings have been conducted by senior members of the Turkish National Police along with local counterterrorism experts, with a budget of Rs300 million, and this first batch is soon to be deployed across Punjab.
The chief minister calls it an ‘historic moment’, hailing the new force as the vanguard in the fight against ‘terrorism, extremism, and sectarianism’. The CTF has been raised as a vital component of last year’s National Internal Security Policy (NISP), which calls for ‘the establishment of a modern, well-equipped Federal Rapid Response Force (RRF). The total strength of the CTF is 1500, which will be spread across Punjab. Special police stations will be established initially in Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Multan. That’s 1500 CT specialists, for a population expected to touch 101 million in 2015.
And while all this sounds great, as is often the case with this current government of ours, all is not hale and hearty.
The following was the eligibility criteria for prospective applicants: a) BA/BSc or equivalent qualification with minimum second division grades; b) domiciled in Punjab; c) age limit 18 to 25 years. And the minimum endurance requirement was a) 1 mile run in 8 minutes for men, and 14 minutes for women; b) 3 chin-ups; c) 20 push-ups in 90 seconds and d) 20 sit ups in 90 seconds. There was also a minimum physical measurements requirement, but hopefully you’ve already gotten the idea.
There was no requirement of prior experience in counterterrorism, policing, or intelligence work. Nor for dealing with suicide attacks, remote-controlled bombs or hostage situations.
As such, the people who enrolled for this force (and have now graduated), are people with MBAs, doctors, engineers and the


like. Anybody who couldn’t find a job jumped at the opportunity. And I don’t blame them. After all, it’s Rs75,000 a month. (In contrast, a constable earns about a puny Rs25,000 a month. But these are counterterrorism corporals!)
The only question to ask is this: are they fit for the job? Can somebody be taught the science and art of counterterrorism in under a year?
The answer is a resounding no.
Why then, was there the need to raise a brand new cadre with zero experience?
To paraphrase Oscar Wilde: because everybody else is taken.
The Elite Force (EF) was originally raised for counterterrorism. However, today all that they do is provide security cover for politicians, senators and the like. Rumour has it that only 10 percent of the Elite Force is available to protect the common Pakistani.
And then there’s the Special Branch (SB). Their core objective is to become the effective eyes and ears of the government and thus assist it in policy formulation, ensuring safety of life and property of the people and maintenance of law and order. But what the SB has been relegated to is snooping on politicians. Who’s drinking what, who’s sleeping with whom and other such racy matters. Yes, they also cover political rallies, corner meetings and the like. But you get the drift.
Two solid organisations, built specifically from within the police and intelligence quarters, for counterterrorism have been relegated to political duties and dirt gathering.
Hence the need for the CTF. By the by, these newly-made CT experts are on a three-year contract, with zero career advancement possibilities. While they have jumped into the frying pan because of their patriotism and the lucrative salary offered, expect major attrition as they realise exactly what they’ve gotten themselves into.
Politicians need security. Everyone understands that. But not from such specialised forces. Take the United States Secret Service (USSS) as an example. It has two areas of responsibility, one of which is the protection of designated current and former politicians. And by association, it also secures all events where these designated politicians are to be present. If anything, Pakistan needs its own version of the SS. The political desks of the SB need to be abolished, and the EF must be released from its political duties.
These two organisations, if allowed to do what they were supposed to, would be a much stronger CT tool than the farcical CTF. But given the current levels of bureaucratic and political involvement within our law-enforcement agencies, the CTF was the best we could do.
Also, the CTF is currently Punjab specific. But as anybody worth their salt in counterterrorism knows, the nerve centre is not Fata, not Punjab, but Karachi. And the city by the sea is a complete different can of worms. A deadly mix of sectarianism, militancy, gangs and armed wings of political parties makes Pakistan’s largest city the most difficult to tackle. Word is that a thousand strong CTF will soon be established for the province. One thousand experts. For a population of at least 42 million.
As a former police officer told me recently, the entire concept of the CTF is nothing more than a band aid on a terminally ill institution.",positive
"The recent arrest of Yousaf al Salafi, a Pakistani Syrian, allegedly the commander of the Islamic State (IS) group in Pakistan, has opened a new front in Pakistan’s counter-terrorism and security quarters, worried that the Middle Eastern terrorist group, which today holds large swathes of territory both in Iraq and Syria, may soon be joining the plethora of organizations that have already made Pakistan their home.
IS, or Daesh, as it is locally known, has already found some partners. In October 2014, six commanders of the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. In the following month, Jundullah, one of the many terror organizations operating under the TTP banner, followed suit.
In November, members of the Jamia Hafsa seminary, based in the capital, Islamabad, released a video in support of not only the IS, but also the Afghan Taliban. And just last month, dozens of disgruntled mid tier commanders from the TTP have also thrown their weight behind the Baghdadi led IS.
One big bowl of Jihad ‘The IS doesn’t have roots here in our region, it will have to lay these roots, rein in people from outside like the Taliban and breakaways from the Lashkar e Jhangvi and others, set an agenda and then launch their campaign’, says Ahmed Rashid, internationally acclaimed terrorism expert and author. ‘If you look at Al Qaeda (AQ), they’ve been here for a quarter of a century, and it’s a player here because it’s run by Pakistanis; it will take the IS a long time to settle down here, especially with the ongoing military campaign. On their prospects in Afghanistan, Rashid believes the Afghans aren’t interested: ‘The Afghan Taliban are nationalist Jihadists, they have no interest in conquering the Middle East or anything else that IS aspires to’
For the past eight months, the Pakistani Military has been conducting a military operation against militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), however,


a secret information report released by the Home and Tribal Affairs Department of the Provincial Government of Baluchistan, suggests that the IS has not only reached out to the AQ affiliate, Lashkar e Jhangvi, but also claims to have already recruited between 10 and 12 thousand members from the Hangu and Kurram agencies.
‘Fighting for Daesh is a lucrative opportunity not only for would-be Jihadists, but also disgruntled militants from other organizations which have either been disbanded, are on the run because of the military operations, or are upset with being told to lay low’ says Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani military scientist and author of the book, Military Inc. ‘The entire network of militancy is ideologically and operationally connected; while there are competing organizations, somewhere down the line, the individual members have many commonalities, including time spent together’
Ayesha cites the birth of IS from within the AQ ranks as an example. And according to Rashid, both Abu Musab al Zarqawi and Abu Bark al Baghdadi, two important personalities in the great Jihadi puzzle, were not only originally members of AQ but also spent time together in Herat, Afghanistan.
Today, it is alleged that the Head of Daesh in Baluchistan, Hafs-al-Baluchi, is a relative of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks. Post Zwahiri: An inevitable eventuality
‘There is an incredible amount of ferment in the whole Jihadi movement right now because of ISIS, both the groups are being careful not to step on each other’s toes’ says Rashid. But for the first time in AQ’s history, it is facing dissent from within. On an online Al Qaeda forum, that has been the house of AQ for a decade, users are calling for Ayman al-Zwahiri’s replacement: ‘Let us gather in this topic signatures that demand allegiance to Sheikh Abu Baseer al-Wuhayshi, emir of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.., and isolate Sheikh Ayman al-Zawahiri...’
The other demand is to transfer the command center of AQ from Khorasan to the Arabian Peninsula. ‘Ayman al-Zwahiri and his cohorts, are not prepared to concede any ground that easily, the formation of AQ in the subcontinent is a case in point’, believes Luca La Bella, Professor of Asian Geopolitics at Universita’ Roma-Tre in Italy. ‘The moment Zwahiri dies, or is replaced, and the AQ central command moves to the Arabian Peninsula, the threat that IS poses to AQ, as a brand and beacon of Global Jihad becomes the most challenging’.
Ayesha, on the other hand, believes that it will eventually boil down to race:’ the Arab bias, for Arabs, is very strong; Mullah Omar calls himself the amir-ul-momineen, but Baghdadi proclaims himself the Khalifa; this has never happened before, and the latter has much more religious significance’.
Indeed, AQ and the Afghan Taliban have had an uneasy relationship at best, with AQ’s presence in Afghanistan one of the major roadblocks for the Taliban’s legitimacy. Experts believe that as the Taliban vie for political inclusion, they will have to clamp down on the spaces currently provided to AQ, creating not only more pressure for the command’s return to the Arabian Peninsula, but also increasing the comfort level between IS and AQ.
Both the Arabian Peninsula and the Khorasan (Afghanistan and Pakistan) are, in the words of Bella, ‘Prime Jihadi real estate’ with great ‘ideological and propaganda value’. While the materialization of the Caliphate dream has been a boon for the IS, AQ has also received a much need shot in the arm by the Paris attacks. But it’s AQ in Yemen. And not Khorasan. For now, both AQ and the IS, are treading lightly, in unchartered waters. But as they territorially grow closer, it looks increasingly likely, that in a post Zwahiri scenario, the two will institutionally merge.In the words of Ayesha Siddiqa, ‘Al Qaeda and IS have only institutional differences, not ideological’.",positive
"The recent high-profile murder of Qandeel Baloch, allegedly killed by her brothers to vindicate their ‘ghairat’ or ‘honour’, has led to the approval of a government-sponsored bill. The proposed draft bill aims at dealing with crimes of ‘honour’. This draft is different from an earlier bill which was introduced by former PPP Senator Sughra Imam and passed by the Senate of Pakistan in March 2015. Both suffer from inadequacies.


A similar effort was initiated in 2004 by the then opposition led by the PPP. The initiative led to the passing of the Criminal Law Amendment 2005 (Act no 1). The 2005 Amendment Act was said to be a watered down version of the bill introduced by the opposition. In similar fashion, the current government sponsored bill weakens in some critical respects the Senator Sughra Imam bill, while offering slight improvement in other respects.

The main criticism of the 2005 Amendment Act was that it left the possibility of waiver and compounding of the offence of crimes of ‘honour’ (compromise between the private parties) open to the extent that it could be read to give the court the discretion to accept or reject such a compromise and acquit the offender. This was either due to ambiguity in how it was drafted, especially the amendment to section 311 when read with section 338 E of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), or otherwise where it clearly left the crimes of honour including murder in the name of ‘honour’ compoundable under section 345 read with the second schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

In both conditions, private parties – legal heirs of the victim in case of murder or the victim herself in case of attempted murder or hurt – could reach an out of court settlement/compromise. However, it could be argued that in the case where section 311 of the PPC (post-2005 amendment) became applicable ‘honour’ killing must be awarded a minimum sentence of ten years of imprisonment. This has happened in some cases decided by superior courts.

Another criticism of the 2005 Amendment Act included, but was not limited to, that the 2005 Amendment Act did not offer a clearer and broader definition of crimes of ‘honour’ and that the definition of ‘fasad-fil-arz’ included the offence of murder in the name of ‘honour’ only.

The Sughra Imam bill focused on removing the possibility of compromise between private parties and turning the crime of ‘honour’ killing, and not all crimes of honour, a crime in which the state would not allow compromise of any kind – neither secular nor Islamic. The bill did not touch the questions of broadening the scope of fasad-fil-arz to all crimes of honour; and the definition of the offence committed in the name of ‘honour’ (section 299 PPC) was left untouched.

The current amended form of the bill sponsored by the government does two or three important things.

It defines fasad-fil-arz to include all crimes of ‘honour’ but it does so without providing a clearer and broader definition compared to the circular definition of the crime committed in the name of ‘honour’ as is currently provided in the penal code.

Further, it changes section 311 of the PPC which prescribes consequences when parties reach a compromise in cases where qisas becomes applicable, to the effect that it raises the punishment for ‘honour’ killing from minimum imprisonment of ten years to imprisonment for life as taazir (secular punishment). And while it seems to make the enhanced punishment mandatory when this amendment is read with proposed changes to sections 345 of the CrPC, a related amendment to column 6 of the second schedule for section 311 of the PPC is not proposed. This is ambiguous and may lead to conflicting decisions by the courts.

The punishment of imprisonment for murder in the name of ‘honour’ is raised to imprisonment for life in all circumstances. The death penalty remains a possibility, though. However, it is questionable whether prescribing imprisonment for life as the only option in the category of imprisonment (for murder in the name of ‘honour’) without an alternate lesser imprisonment for cases where there may be compelling mitigating circumstances, including non-availability of direct evidence, is the right approach.

The bill keeps other forms of crimes of ‘honour’ such as all hurts and attempted ‘honour’ killing compoundable. This is a dimension which seems to have escaped serious consideration.

There is another issue that is very likely to crop up at some point. In the current framework for proof of crimes committed in the name of ‘honour’ the motive of ‘honour’ must be proved; this is an extraordinary condition as proof of motive is not necessary in ordinary cases. Proving motive is not easy in all cases. Proof of the commission of an offence, murder or others, and the intention, per se, to do so is considered to be enough.

In ‘honour’ related crimes intention would be proved through the proof that the offence is committed in the name of ‘honour’. In complex cases, where the reason/motive is not easy to establish, the offenders may raise a motive different from ‘honour’. This problem will persist unless the provisions relating to qisas and diyat are completely eliminated and the state restores to itself the space ceded on the pretext of Islamisation of criminal law.

The issue of amending the law to provide protection to women from crimes of honour is a complex one. It may not be done in one stroke, and it may require many minds to wriggle out of the complexity. Some of the recommendations which may be made in light of the foregoing analysis may include.

If the current broader framework of qisas and diyat must stay for the time being, any proposal to amend the law must provide a clearer and broader definition of ‘honour’ crimes to include a range of offences against women. The definition may be phrased in such a way that it is considered by courts to be inclusive rather than exhaustive.

Ideally, all offences against women – especially all bodily hurts, attempted murder, and murders by close relatives – should not be allowed to be ‘waived’ and/or ‘compounded’ by close relatives/survivors. The Islamic concept of fasad-fil-arz may be applied to all such crimes which give courts the power to disregard waiver and compounding on behalf of close relatives or the victim herself.

Further, compounding of offences punishable under taazir (secular punishment) should not be an option and no discretion should be vested with the courts in this respect.

The state must prosecute all such crimes, and such prosecution must necessarily result in conviction and sentencing instead of compromise between private parties.

The framework of punishments needs to be such that in the absence of compelling evidence where maximum punishment cannot be awarded, courts have the discretion to award lesser punishments. But such discretion should be narrowly and strictly prescribed so that it may not be used to the disadvantage of the victims – who are mostly women.

The current bill is being kept under wraps by the government for fear of backlash from retrogressive elements within and outside the ruling party, including the Council of Islamic Ideology. But if the government is serious about liberating the women of this country from the fear that afflicts their lives, it must allow a fearless debate to take place. Appropriate changes in the legislative framework to provide protection to the women of Pakistan will be just one of the many small steps that need to be taken.",positive
"As an academic, I welcome the defence of the Single National Curriculum (The SNC as ‘the way forward’, The News, October 15, 2020) offered by Zulfiqar Ali Shaikh from the Ministry of Education. It provides a ‘teaching moment’ illuminating not just the SNC but other more important things besides.


Let me deconstruct it piece by piece, and leave it to the readers to derive the lessons.

The opening paragraph says a lot: “Facts take a backseat when a handful of people view well-intentioned developmental agendas through lens smeared with suspicion and an urge for professional recognition.” One sentence reveals so much about how our governments act – ignore the argument; attack the character, integrity, and motivation of those asking questions. Think through the charge that has been leveled: those who disagree with the SNC are distorting facts in order to obtain professional recognition.

Consider the fact that one of the leading critics is Dr Tariq Rehman, a Humboldt Laureate, HEC distinguished national professor, dean of education at a leading university, the first incumbent of the Pakistan Chair at the University of California at Berkeley, a scholar honoured by the government of Pakistan with a Pride of Performance Award for Research and a Sitara-e-Imtiaz. Does he need any more professional recognition? Can he be credibly accused of distorting facts?

Or consider Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy, another critic of the SNC. A PhD from MIT, holder of the Unesco Kalinga Prize and the Abdus Salam Award, conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of British Columbia and a Sitara-e-Imtiaz by the government of Pakistan which he declined. What is the professional recognition Dr Hoodbhoy is seeking by questioning the SNC, and from whom?

What is meant by leveling charges of this kind? That the government cannot defend its ‘well-intentioned development agenda’ on its own merits and can only malign the critics instead. Reflect on the fact that being well-intentioned does not guarantee being right or sensible.

If well-intentioned disasters are to be avoided, the questions posed by eminent scholars like Dr Rehman and Dr Hoodbhoy ought to be welcomed and taken seriously. A government that really wishes to design a robust policy should care when scholars of this calibre are unconvinced. It should strive to find the reasons for their reservations.

Citizens, on the other hand, should be concerned when their governments are so impervious to open discussion and so afraid of questions from eminent scholars that their first reaction is to malign them to the extent of just short of labeling them anti-state.

Consider this justification of the SNC that has been offered: “It is clearly intended as a first step towards paving the way for all children to access a level-playing field whether they are in public or private sector schools or madressahs and the multitude of other educational institutions throughout the country.”

If the curriculum in Aitchison College and Government School No 2 in Dharampura is made the same, would that be the first step to a level playing field for the students of the two schools? If the government truly wishes to level the playing field, is this really the most innovative first step it can think of? Are qualified citizens allowed to suggest some other first steps that might be more effective in a much shorter time frame?

And here is the defence of last resort: “Most of the criticism of the SNC, coming forth so far, is modernist backlash based on a misperceived notion of Islamization through a heavier content of Islamiat in the SNC as compared to before.” Surprise, surprise – the proponents are pro-Islam and the critics are anti-Islam with a ‘misperceived’ notion of Islamization. Case closed. But what exactly is a well-perceived notion of Islamization? One that accords with the views of the government? Did Zia ul Haq have a well-perceived notion of Islamization? Can this issue be debated without the questioners being stoned to death?

Consider now this pronouncement: “It is pertinent to note that a curriculum emanates from within a society and is based on its needs and aspirations for the education system to deliver context specific relevant learning within national and global considerations.” What does this mean? How does a curriculum emanate from within a society? Like a plant that grows out of the soil? But that plant could be a flower or a weed. What convinces the government that its product is the best there can be and is so wonderful that it cannot withstand the scrutiny of eminent scholars who have to be demeaned? Wouldn’t any alternative curriculum also not emanate from the same society?

The ministry considers it sufficient that the SNC was made by “a galaxy of 400 star performers” and that these “champions of change, unparalleled in their field of expertise,” were “driven by a common dream.” Dr Rehman and Dr Hoodbhoy, for all their credentials, did not make it into the top 400 star performers in the country. Or, I suppose the condition of subscribing in advance to a common dream ruled them out.

As the defence states: “At a time when concrete steps are being taken under an all-inclusive (sic) participatory approach for updating the blueprint for our children’s education, it is obligatory on all stakeholders to join hands for the national dream of the SNC.” It is not to question what qualifies as a national dream. It’s but to do and die. Here we have a reenactment of the Charge of the Light Brigade now comprising the valiant four hundred.

Defy your obligation Dr Rehman and Dr Hoodbhoy and your fate would be the one pronounced by the Red Queen. “Oh, do not ask, “What is it?” / Let us go and make our visit.”",positive
"The Single National Curriculum has some very laudable objectives including raising good human beings and promoting inclusiveness and tolerance. It has decided on a methodology to achieve these aims. For the sake of discussion, I am suggesting an alternative to the proposed methodology.

The chosen methodology leans heavily on religion as the vehicle for raising good human beings. Muslim children will be introduced to Ahadees, Ayaat and Quranic injunctions in support of habits that include speaking the truth, respecting one’s elders, being kind to fellow humans and animals; and of beliefs that all citizens have an equal standing in society regardless of religion, ethnicity, language, gender and colour.

Muslim children will be learning these good things by memorizing the relevant Ahadees, Ayaat, and Quranic injunctions – and will be tested on them. While Muslim children are attending the class on their religion, all non-Muslim students would leave and go to segregated classes, separate for all religions, where they would be taught exactly the same good habits drawing from their own scriptures.

Religion can be a very good vehicle for teaching these basic lessons but dividing children, who might otherwise be very close friends, into separate groups every day may not be the best of ideas. Young children would inevitably ask why some of them have to leave the class and would have to be told that it is so because they are different. The consciousness of difference would be ingrained from day one. The aim of inclusiveness would be compromised and that of tolerance would be strained.

Could exactly the same goals be achieved without sacrificing inclusion and incurring the negative psychic costs of physical separation? How about experimenting with the following alternative: All children stay together and learn together. This is possible because all controversial material has already been sensibly removed from the SNC. Thus, if the lesson is about speaking the truth, the relevant messages from all religions can be listed on the blackboard. Similarly, for lessons pertaining to respecting elders, treating others with kindness, etc.

It is hard to imagine that any religion would have messages contrary to the essential traits of good conduct. It would be a huge gain if by going through such a collective exercise, children learn in a convivial environment about other religions and also that all religions emphasise similar good things – they are different roads leading to the same destination.

These collective exercises could be extended by exploring what the places of worship of different religions look like, on what date the new year begins for different religions and how it is celebrated, what are the different rituals at birth, marriage, death, etc. At a certain stage, students can be taken on visits to different places of worship and encouraged to engage with the caretakers to satisfy their queries.

Such an approach would encourage curiosity, prompt students to ask questions, and promote mutual understanding in a positive and non-artificial manner. It would also obviate the need to memorize anything. Anyone who has been close to education knows that memorization, especially of material that cannot be imagined, is detrimental in every way. It stunts the intellectual development of children.

Good habits pertain not just to conduct. Good mental habits are equally important and they cannot be inculcated by memorization. In fact, excessive memorization of normative content dulls mental capacity by taking away agency and replacing behaviour based on intelligence by that based on fear of punishment. And why persist with a failed approach in any case?

Educationists who have kept up with the subject also know that children learn in very different ways – some respond more to aural stimuli, others to visual cues, and yet others to tactile inputs. Some love to put things together, others to take them apart. If allowed the freedom, children gravitate to what excites them most. Instead of regimenting all children into a standard format and boring most of them to tears, the first few years are the time when a teacher observes and groups children by how they learn best. Once their learning ability is unleashed, they progress much faster than children raised in the equivalent of chicken coops or cattle stalls.

Let us have faith in our children and give them a chance to develop into intelligent human beings leading fulfilling lives. Yes, they will ask questions but what kind of an adult is afraid of questions children might ask?",positive
"The Covid-19 pandemic has hit education hard. Schools and colleges have been closed since March which has resulted in a lot of handwringing, with both educationists and students deploring the time wasted. Now the government has announced September 15 as the date of a phased resumption of schools.


This decision is based partly on the determination that the pandemic has been controlled in Pakistan; but experience from many countries that had thought likewise has shown that such relaxation can be premature. Across the world, educational institutions have opened only to be closed again because of the emergence of infection clusters.

This is not surprising because the virus has not been eliminated anywhere. It has been successfully localized in many places but as soon as large-scale movement is permitted across locations, it has shown a propensity to cross borders and resurge. With millions of students, staff, and service personnel moving in and out, such a resurgence remains a major risk. Where human lives are at stake the maximum caution is warranted.

But what then is to be done to address the seemingly genuine lamentations about the time being wasted? I would recommend substituting creative thinking for fruitless whining that does no good and can do considerable harm by rushing reopening while the virus is still active and credible evidence to suggest herd immunity is not available.

It is ironic that when students are actually attending classes in person, educationists tell them that most learning takes place outside the classroom. Now that students are actually out of classrooms, the same educationists are unable to convert that opportunity into any kind of learning. This can only mean that they were repeating an aphorism without having given it much thought themselves.

Learning outside the classroom is even more relevant in Pakistan compared to other countries because too much of what is taught in the class is outdated, dull, and boring. Many teachers in low-income public schools know less than the students and even in colleges considered decent, many just read out from notes that they inherited from their predecessors.

It is true that one aspect of learning outside the classroom derives from what students learn from each other and this is lost when institutions are closed. But other students are not the only peers from whom one can learn. All of society constitutes both a peer group and a laboratory rich in learning potential from which a student can benefit with just a little guidance.

Consider the fact that many students in other countries voluntarily take a year off from school or college because they wish to enrich their education in ways that are not possible in the normal course. We canm think of the break imposed by the pandemic as an enforced time off for all our students. How can we use it to advance a different form of learning that goes beyond classroom education?

For smart educationists, this should not be a difficult proposition. Instead of preparing lectures that are to be delivered online and consumed inside homes, they could assign tasks to students that would require them to go out and explore their neighbourhoods to find out how life has been impacted by the pandemic.

Such exercises can range from the simple to the complex, depending on the maturity of the student. At the simplest level, a student could survey a hundred households in his or her neighbourhood to document the number of infections and deaths that have been caused by the pandemic, how households have coped with these, and what other hardships have ensued.

A similar exercise can document the economic impact of the pandemic. How many have lost their livelihoods, what have been the coping mechanisms and how have lives been impacted.

More advanced students can engage in industry, profession, or institution specific studies. How have small and medium enterprises in various sectors been impacted, what has been happening inside hospitals and clinics, and how have various service providers fared. Other students can ascertain the number of burials in local graveyards and compare them with the same period for previous years.

Such a pedagogical orientation can have multiple benefits. First, crowd-sourced information, carefully gathered, can fill a huge data gap pertaining especially to small towns that are largely off the official radar. A much richer profile of what is really happening on the ground as a result of the pandemic would emerge.

Data received from diverse locations could help put together a map of the country identifying areas differently impacted by the pandemic enabling resources to be directed to those most in need. Students would not only gain knowledge of their places of residence but become aware of other places in the country when the studies are shared and discussed online.

Second, students would gain experiential knowledge and the invaluable skill of doing research as their progress reports are critiqued by their teachers. They would also learn how to express themselves by having to write coherent accounts whose linguistic quality would be monitored by another set of instructors.

Through such a participatory process, students would become active agents in the documentation, monitoring, and management of the pandemic and be able to suggest practical recommendations to mitigate its effects. They would also become familiar with their neighbourhoods to serve as community workers in public health campaigns and economic assistance initiatives where needed.

The learning generated from such a pedagogical orientation can easily outweigh the loss from suspension of in-person classes. Creative teachers can incentivise such learning by making it eligible for academic credit. The design of a senior thesis is particularly amenable to such a research and supervision model.

With a little modification such a model is also feasible for children enrolled in schools. Teachers can supervise groups of children and engage them in outdoor activities exploring local flora and fauna, natural habitats, and places of historic interest. Organizing discussions around these would add much more to knowledge than any number of lessons in the classroom.

With a little more creativity and a little less complaining, suspension of the normal course of activities can be turned into a huge learning opportunity that can have the added benefit of getting students to know much more about themselves, their fellow citizens, and their localities. Instead of seeing themselves as passive victims, students can become active participants in a campaign to help their country and society in a once-in-a-lifetime challenge.",positive
"Neelam Hanif has mounted a passionate defence of English as the medium of instruction (‘SNC and the language question’, The News, September 12, 2020) but I fear the passion is misspent.

Look at the beginning: “English… is part of the colonial baggage we carry. From aspiring to be fair-skinned to being fluent in this historically contentious language is our most coveted wish.” And now consider the end: “This language has been part of our culture and heritage for the past two hundred years. It is time to own it, and use it to our advantage in training our children to face the challenges of our collective global future.” How can the two be reconciled?

Just these two sentences let loose a flood of questions both cynical and serious. If English is a “colonial baggage” why is it time to “own it”? Isn’t baggage something one wants to shed? Climate change is the biggest challenge of the global future; are people who don’t know English unable to face it? Being fair-skinned is as valuable in the marital market as English is in the job market. Why don’t we own that part of the colonial baggage as well and use it to the advantage of our children?

But let me move beyond cynical and serious to the really profound question. The writer wants an early start in English because “Implementing Urdu or regional languages in the early grades is also not a solution as that will further impede children from learning English and competing with children from elite schools.” Does one really believe that knowing English would enable poor children to compete with children from elite schools? Could we please look at the US where everyone learns English from day one? Does that enable the poor to compete with the rich?

Why don’t we look at the evidence? Two-thirds of students at Ivy League universities come from the top fifth of the income scale. The relationship between social class and admission test scores has been known for decades. Social mobility in the US is stalled – the poor remain poor whether they know English or not. In the US, it is particularly easy to see because it is in black and white. There is no confounding problem of Urdu or regional languages there. So how can one make a chimerical claim of this sort and base an entire policy on it?

Does teaching regional languages in the early grades really impede children from learning English? How did millions of non-English speakers from Europe learn English when they needed it? Did Nabokov or Conrad or Brodsky, all of whom wrote in English at the highest level, grow up speaking the language? Why is native-English fluency our aim anyway when all we are concerned with is white-collar jobs?

Ms Hanif is chasing a Quixotic dream and ends up unsurprisingly tilting at windmills. She is so convinced that English will help the poor compete with the rich that she is prepared to turn the entire society upside down to achieve it. “This government needs to provide equal opportunities to the children of public schools and madressahs to acquire the English language. This would require a team of teachers to be trained in theory and practices of English Language Teaching and to have intensive language programs initiated in these institutions.

“This would also mean developing materials for these schools and equipping them with libraries and computer labs. The government needs to provide underprivileged children with the environment conducive to acquiring the language that will bring them at par with the children from the elite schools.”

Where does one begin? Governments that have been unable to provide a one-room building for 20 million out-of-school-children and toilets for millions of in-school children are going to do all this especially if that would enable the poor to compete with the rich? And given that fluency in English can propel people to the highest echelons of society, all the highly trained teachers would remain teaching in public schools instead of migrating to Dubai?

I am entirely with the writer in question in wishing for a level playing field but one can get there much more easily than the one proposed. If one really wants to fight for a level linguistic playing field, one should fight to have all entrance examinations in local languages. It would be much easier for a privileged minority to learn local languages than for an impoverished majority to be fluent in English. They would do it the same way they acquired the “colonial baggage” even though they were not born carrying it.

Unfortunately, a level linguistic playing field will do little to alter class differences. We have to be cognitive of the system in which we exist – economic inequality has increased in parallel with greater access to education even in the US. Those who believe structural inequality can be addressed by learning a language need to reflect deeply and provide some evidence of where that has happened before. In the absence of such evidence, they need to rethink their recommendations.

I can assure Ms Hanif that children fluent in local languages and taught to think in them will be able to face the challenges of our collective global future. They might even be able to learn English on their own if they felt the need for it.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation on Monday approved divestment of majority stake in state-owned Heavy Electrical Complex and transaction structure for sale of the House Building Finance Company.


The cabinet committee meeting, presided over by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Hafeez Shaikh, approved the transaction structure for the divestment of 96.6 percent shares of Heavy Electrical Complex (HEC).

The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) directed the ministry of industries and production for the amicable and earliest resolution of issues related to regular employees of HEC. There are 238 employees working at HEC and out of which 213 are casual workers and remaining are officers.

The Privatisation Commission failed to sell HEC several times in the past, but now it renewed efforts to accomplish the task, according to sources. The government will keep the share of Benazir scheme in the HEC intact, they said.

Sources said the power division had showed interest in getting control of HEC. Now things are moving towards divestment, they said. However, it is not yet known how much interest the private sector will show to take over control.

The meeting also approved the transaction structure for the privatisation of the House Building Finance Company (HBFCL). The power division was also asked to consider extending the validity of type testing licence of Heavy Mechanical Complex.

The decision was already taken in August, but was not ratified by the cabinet for want of some additional information regarding the profitability and other issues of the entity. The meeting was told that if the transaction proceeds ahead, the new investor can bring in capital, operational expertise, capacity enhancement of HBFCL and new product development, which would eventually enhance its profitability and market share in housing mortgage for middle and low income groups of the society. The CCoP accepted the proposal for moving ahead with the transaction structure for divestment.

The CCoP also constituted a committee to improve the transaction structure for Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) in consultation with the appointed financial/transaction adviser for further incorporation of market requirements.

The CCoP also approved the recommendation of the Privatization Commission Board to open, operate and close accounts in scheduled banks for the execution of privatisation transactions, including other operations in compliance with the central bank’s guidelines.

The meeting was told that out of the 27 properties the bid price for 23 had been received. The financial adviser was asked to recommend a way forward on two unsold properties in Multan and Rahim Yar Khan. The committee also directed to engage the chief secretaries of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab to resolve pending issues relating to two properties in Swat and Lahore.

The CCoP also constituted a committee to look into various sectoral issues related to the privatisation of National Power Parks Management Company. The committee will meet within week to deliberate on the way forward. This committee will specify issues and set up guidelines for addressing all the pending issues with relevant quarters.

The CCoP approved the guidelines for all concerned ministries/ divisions to ensure that the management of public sector enterprises, falling under the domain of the Privatization Commission, runs smoothly. The guidelines direct all concerned to comply with the model checklist of the actions that may be taken/ should not be taken by an enterprise on the privatization list, as well as other instructions issued by the Privatization Commission for each transaction from time to time.

The CCoP directed officials to resolve all the issues before the initiation of privatisation process. The committee approved a model questionnaire that would help in gathering all the relevant information regarding the entity that has been approved for privatisation.

All ministries/divisions and state-owned enterprises – having assets in the privatisation list – will provide information required in the model questionnaire to the Privatization Commission within 30 days from the date such request reaches the relevant department.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s weekly inflation fell to a three-month low and was recorded at 7.68 per cent at the week ending on Nov 12, over the corresponding week of the last fiscal. Last week, it was recoded at 8.93pc.

Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) measures weekly inflationary pressure in the economy and it has been downed by 0.07pc over the previous week, as food prices declined. Every week, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) collects prices of 51 essential items from 50 markets in 17 cities. The month of November started with lower weekly inflation. If the trend continues, then we may see a lower reading of the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Prime Minister Imran Khan has also tweeted, saying inflation is reducing now and it will be brought down further. “Our Sensitive Price Index shows a decline for 2nd consecutive week, in contrast to the situation in other parts of the Subcontinent. InshaAllah, we will bring inflation further under control,” the PM said.

Moreover, having a cursory look at the SPI bulletin, the lowest income slab was the hardest-hit compared to the affluent spending group. The SPI for the expenditure group (quintile 1), spending up to Rs17,732/month was 9.30pc, while for the group spending more than 44,175/month, it recorded at 6.84pc.

Average prices of 18 items (35.29pc) registered an increase, 11 items (21.57pc) registered a decrease, while prices of 22 items (43.13pc) did not show any change. Tomatoes prices in one week declined by 2.75pc to Rs144 per kilogram, moong pulse 1.42pc to Rs229/kg, gur 1.15pc to Rs129/kg, gram pulse 1pc to Rs142/kg and garlic price reduced by 1pc to Rs235/kg.

Less than a per cent decline was also seen in the prices of some items. These include onions with 0.59pc to Rs78/kg, wheat flour 0.47pc to Rs984/20kg bag, mutton 0.31pc to Rs983/kg, masoor pulse 0.26pc to Rs160/kg and rice Irri 6/9 price down by 0.17pc to Rs71/kg. Among non-food items, the electricity tariff for the lowest consumption slab reduced by 2.78pc to Rs3.85/unit.

The SPI also recorded an increase in the prices of some items. Chicken price increased by 10.63pc to Rs234/kg, bananas 2.74pc to Rs65/dozen, match box 2pc to Rs3/box, cooked beef 1.09pc to Rs147/plate, sugar 0.56pc to Rs102/kg and potatoes price increased by 0.54pc to Rs74/kg.

The Bureau further reported that year on year, chillies powder price increased by 86pc to Rs280/packet, potatoes 63pc to Rs74/kg, eggs 48pc to Rs169/kg, chicken 46pc to Rs234/kg, sugar 41pc to 102/kg, mash pulse 23pc to Rs250/kg, match box 23pc to Rs3/box, moong pulse 23pc Rs229/kg, washing soap 21pc,masoor pulse 20pc to 160/kg, gur 18pc to Rs129/kg, bread 17pc to Rs55, long cloth 16pc to Rs350/meter, vegetable ghee 16pc to 248/kg and rice Irri 6/9 16pc to Rs71/kg.

While the major decrease was observed in the price of tomatoes 30.20pc to Rs144/kg, garlic 19pc Rs235/kg, diesel 19pc to Rs104.22/litre, onions 10pc to Rs78/kg, petrol 10pc to Rs103.4/litre, electricity 9pc to Rs3.85/unit and LPG down by 2pc to Rs1428/cylinder.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: Owing to the appreciating rupee against the US dollar, the government is likely to reduce the petrol and diesel prices for the second half of this month. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) working has revealed that there is room for Rs3.40 per litre cut in petrol and Rs2.5 per litre in diesel prices, sources said.


Earlier, for the first fortnight of November, the government had slashed the petrol price by Rs1.57 per litre and diesel by Re0.84 per litre, while kerosene and Light Diesel Oil (LDO) prices were kept unchanged.

Petrol is being sold now at Rs102.40 per litre, diesel Rs103.22 per litre, Kerosene Rs65.29 per litre and LDO at Rs62.86 per litre. The regulator will send the summary to the Finance Division. The government would make a decision on November 15 to make it effective from the next day.

In the months to come, the consumption of diesel and petrol can increase. In winter, due to gas shortages, CNG filling stations could face gas supply problems. So car owners will shift to petrol. Since the Rabi season has started, so diesel’s demand will also increase as crops, including wheat, are being sown. According to the latest analysis by the JS Global Capital, the sale of petroleum products has touched a two-year high of 1.7 million tons in October. It increased by 11 percent over the previous month.

Revival of economic and business activities can be attributed to this spike. Diesel sale in October increased by 43 percent to 0.67 million tons against 0.47 million tons in September. In the same month of the last year, its sale stood at 0.65 million tons. Petrol sale jacked up by seven percent to 0.69 million tons in October compared to 0.64 million tons in September.

Meanwhile, the rupee is gaining strength against the US dollar for the last several months due to foreign inflows. Only on Friday, it gained 17 paisas in interbank against the dollar. A State Bank of Pakistan tweet said the US dollar on Friday opened at Rs158.33 and closed at Rs158.16. This level was last seen eight months ago in mid-March. During this week, the rupee gained Rs0.93 against the greenback.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has drastically reduced the Unaccounted for Gas (UFG) on RLNG to 6.3 percent which was earlier up to 17 percent. The reduction in UFG will have a positive impact on the imported gas price, thus benefiting the industrial sector.

A senior official of Ogra confirmed it to ‘The News’ on Wednesday that it has been provisionally decided and will be applicable from the last month. However, after a detailed audit of the sector by an international auditor, this will be finally decided. He added that this decision will reduce the RLNG prices in the country. Interestingly, it will also help reduce the power generation cost, as around a third of energy is coming from RLNG-based plants. Power consumers will also get the benefit from it.

The official said that this reduction was only for RLNG consumers and not for the domestic gas consumers. It indicates that Pakistani industrial sector, including textiles, fertilizer, CNG and other sectors, who consume imported gas, will benefit the most.

UFG is a phenomenon of gas loss, which is contingent upon the occurrence of various technical factors when gas flows from source to end consumers. It is charged from the gas consumers. Earlier, Ogra had allowed 11 to 17 percent UFG to the Sui companies on the distribution of RLNG to consumers.

The official said that the ECC had recently asked for charging the actual UFG from the RLNG consumers. According to initial estimates, UFG on RLNG has been worked out at 6.3 percent. Now, the SNGPL and SSGCL will charge it at the same ratio.

“This decision would also encourage private investors to invest in the LNG sector in Pakistan,” an energy expert said. He added that the PTI government had already allowed the private sector to import LNG. The CNG, textile sector and fertilizer have applied for getting the regasification capacity at terminal-II. The official said that the government also wants to end the monopoly of gas companies and encourage the private sector to enter into this market.

Under the 15-year LNG import deal signed during the previous government with Qatar, Pakistan is importing most of its LNG from this gas-rich gulf country. The regulator decides local gas prices every six months and LNG price every month.

The federal government had recently sought the provinces’ support on the weighted average gas price to reduce this imported gas. The prime minister in the recent Council of Common Interests (CCI) meeting had placed the proposal before the provinces, but they did not agree to it.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan Tuesday announced a major relief package for industries by abolishing 'peak-hour' tariff for all industries, alongside a 50 percent concession on additional electricity consumption to boost industrialization and increase exports.

Addressing a news briefing here along with federal ministers and finance adviser, he said the electricity generated in Pakistan was 25 percent more expensive than in India and Bangladesh, due to which our exports were not competitive. “But with the new package, our industry will become more competitive on the international and local levels, which will also have an impact on prices,"" he said.

The prime minister said, ""From November to June 2021, the Small and Medium Enterprises using additional power will be provided with electricity at 50 percent of the rate.""

Furthermore, for the next three years, he said additional power would be provided to all types of industries at 25pc lower tariff, meaning that full-time off-hours would now be considered for industries. He expressed hope that the new package will boost exports.

In the backdrop of a briefing to the cabinet earlier, where it was told about the increasing number of coronavirus cases, the prime minister directed strict implementation of SOPs.

Imran said the government would not close the industries as the country could not afford a lockdown once again. He emphasized that the provinces should ensure the implementation of TTQ and smart lockdown strategy. However, he appealed to the people to wear masks when going out and to strictly follow the SOPs.

The prime minister contended that the second wave of coronavirus was spreading rapidly in the world and cases were similarly increasing in Pakistan. He said Allah Almighty has been extra kind to Pakistan, we have made wise decisions and Allah has been gracious. However, he clarified that if the coronavirus situation turned alarming, industries and businesses would have to run with SOPs.

Explaining the reasons for the high cost of electricity, Imran Khan said that expensive power contracts were signed by the previous governments due to which our industry had to compete with low-cost power-consuming regional industries. Hepointed out that Pakistan’s exports during 2013 to 2018 declined, falling from USD25 billion to USD20 billion. He said that his government tried to increase the exports soon after coming to power because the country's wealth is directly linked with exports, which would strengthen the rupee. “We have given lots of concessions to exporters and Pakistan is the only country in the Sub-continent whose exports emerged from the effects of the epidemic fast. Pakistan has dealt with the epidemic situation in the best manner and that has been recognised globally,” Imran said.

The prime minister said that he was happy that despite the global epidemic, cement sales in Pakistan had reached record levels, sales of vehicles and motorcycles had also recorded an increase, while the construction industry was also developing, which would create more employment opportunities. ""The flourishing industry will bring wealth to the country, which will enable us to repay our debts,"" he said.

Under the new package for an industrial consumer, if the consumer has used 100 units in November last and this November the consumer consumes 150 units, then the 100 units will be charged with normal rates while the additional 50 units will be charged 50pc less than the normal tariff. ""So whatever amount of electricity they use in addition to the level that they used last November, it will cost [half] of what it did previously,"" the prime minister explained. ""For example, electricity that cost Rs16 per unit will now cost Rs8.”

He said the government had decided that SMEs would get additional electricity at reduced rates from Nov 1 till 30th of June next year.

Minister for Industries and Production, Hammad Azhar, said the peak-hour [7 pm to 11 pm] power tariff was always around 25pc higher than off-peak hours. After removing the peak-hour concept for industries, apart from a 50pc cut in tariff on additional consumption, their bills will minimize sizably. Since the prime minister has stressed on facilitating the industries with low input costs, production can be increased and, in turn, more employment generated. ""So we have made a huge decision today, a tough decision, and the cabinet has approved it."" Azhar said that the decision means that “industries could avail off-peak hour benefits around the clock.”

The SMEs [B1, B2 and B3 connections] will enjoy a 50pc cut in tariff on additional consumption up to June 2021. For other industries (B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5 connections), the cut will be 25pc for the next three years.

“The cement, fertilizer, auto, motorcycle, textiles, steel, and other large scale manufacturing is growing. Orders are coming; industries are increasing their working shifts. This will create more jobs and market activities will also witness a boom. Our products will become competitive in the international market,” the industrial minister said.

Federal Minister for Planning, Development, Reforms and Special Initiatives Asad Umar said that energy reforms are continuing since the government came into power. “With this decision, the wheel of the economy will move faster.” During the Covid-19 pandemic, we had tried our best to insulate the poor from the negative fallout of this disease and did not place a ban on their works and jobs. “We will not close the industries at any cost, it will run now 24 hours,” he said.

The Federal Energy Minister, Omar Ayub Khan, said that “we are facing the landmines what the previous governments had laid for us in the energy sector (including costly power agreements). Now we are coming out of it."" Earlier, 70pc of our energy generation was based on imported fuel (LNG, fuel oil and coal) while renewables (solar, wind, etc) were discouraged. They conducted solar power agreements as high as Rs24/unit whereas we have made the agreements at Rs6.5/unit. He said by 2025 the share of renewables will be 25pc in our energy mix. By 2030, it will be increased to 30pc. The volume of renewables will be increased to 18,000MWs by 2030. The hydropower share will be increased by 30 percent from the current level and the local Thar coal's share will also be increased up to 20pc.

Adviser to Prime Minister on Finance Dr. Abdul Hafeez Shaikh said that we have brought stability to the economy. “Pakistani people are the centre of our policies. We have increased tax collections by 17pc in the last four months. The government has also cut its own expenditures while kept the civil and military expenditures frozen. We did not borrow even a single penny from the Central Bank [it was a condition of the IMF]. Our primary balance is in surplus. We have brought down the Current Account Deficit from $20 billion to zero now. “We had paid refunds of Rs250 billion to the industries and businesses. On affordable houses, we have also given 90pc tax exemption to builders.”

He added, ""Our construction industry is also booming. Our remittances, exports, industrial growth, Current Account Surplus, primary balance are fast improving. Our stock market has become the top performer in Asia and fourth in the entire world. The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed outstanding performance and was ranked fourth in the world and the first in Asia among the most performing markets. We had repaid Rs5,000 billion (more than $31 billion) loans, what the previous government had taken.""

""During the period from June 30 to November 1st, there was zero percent increase in the country’s debt,” he concluded.Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Shibli Faraz Tuesday blamed the Sindh government for not releasing wheat, which created the supply and demand issue.

Speaking at a news conference here after attending the federal cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, he alleged that the Sindh government with mala fide intentions announced Rs2,000 per 40kg as the wheat support price, which was the federal government’s mandate. “With this support price, will flour be cheaper or costly? Definitely it will be costly,” he remarked.

Regarding the price of sugar increasing to Rs110 per kg despite its import and the government’s announcement of reduction in its price, the minister said the prices would come down and that the government was working on proper record keeping, as it had to rely on the mills data, which was manipulated by the owners.

He recalled how the Sindh government had tried to mislead the federal government on Covid-19 adding that the results would have been disastrous had the Centre followed it. He blamed the Sindh government for the sugar and wheat crisis.

He called the policy of Sindh not timely releasing wheat as hoarding and playing politics thereon. He said their role was shameful and the people of Gilgit-Baltistan would ask them about that. About the tomato prices soaring to Rs200 per kg, the minister said the government was aware of it and would take every possible step to bring them down.

“We are in the government because of people. How is it possible that we have no realization of their difficulties? Various steps are being taken to provide relief to them like the USC and Sahulat bazaars. It’s not the government’s job to produce or sell vegetables but it can facilitate and this is what is being done. Various factors are behind the high price of tomatoes,” he noted, showing optimism that the difficult phase would soon be over. He said they would not follow Ishaq Dar, who had suggested people to consume chicken, as the rates of pulses were higher. ",positive
"ISLAMABAD: The government on Saturday reduced petrol price by Rs1.57/litre and diesel by Re0.84/litre, while kerosene and light diesel oil prices have been kept unchanged for the next fortnight.

"ISLAMABAD: The United Arab Emirates has announced that it administered over 28 million polio vaccine doses in Pakistan during July to September 2020 and reached over 16 million children.

Pakistan is one of the three remaining countries in the world along with Afghanistan and Nigeria, which are yet to be declared polio-free, a virus that has not been seen in the rest of the world since 1990.

The UAE government is extending a helping hand to Pakistan to make the country polio-free by the year 2022 through its polio initiative in Pakistan called the Emirates Polio Campaign (EPC). The EPC announced this on 8th annual World Polio day that it had administered over 28 million vaccine doses in Pakistan between July and September 2020, reaching over 16 million children. The Emirates Polio Campaign was launched in 2014 after 306 cases were reported in Pakistan which amounted to 85 per cent of the cases that year in the whole world. The initiative was launched under the directives of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to provide help and humanitarian assistance to the people of Pakistan and support their development initiatives for a better future.

The announcement comes on the heels of the EPC’s recent announcement that it had completed the world’s first polio vaccination campaign since the outbreak of Covid-19 this spring. Pakistan, which has been labeled the “final frontier for global polio eradication” by the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, has recorded 79 wild polio cases so far in 2020, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Last year, the country reported 147 cases, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

The campaign works in cooperation with the command of Pakistan armed forces, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the Pakistani Ministry of National Health Services, and Ministries of Health offices in the provincial governments.

Since its launching, the campaign has delivered more than 483 million polio vaccines, reaching 86 million children across Pakistan. Director of the UAE Pakistan Assistance Programme Abdullah Khalifa Al-Ghafli stated that ""the EPC reflects Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s commitment to strengthen global cooperation to prevent the spread of polio and to protect children from this preventable disease.

""Since its founding, the EPC has accomplished a tremendous amount in reaching millions of children with this critical vaccination. We know there is still work ahead in our goal of ensuring every child has a chance at a healthy future and we remain committed to the last mile in eradicating this disease.""

Earlier this year, vaccination programmes around the world were halted due to the outbreak of Covid-19 and many leaders in the health community warned of a potential new polio crisis. However, the Emirates Polio Campaign overcame these new challenges and was the first programme in the world to resume polio vaccinations. Since resuming vaccination campaigns in July, the EPC has also taken a strong role in protecting and educating the communities they serve about Covid-19.

During July and August, frontline health workers distributed hundreds of thousands of masks and sanitisers to homes as well as health facilities. In addition, through the frontline health workers network, the EPC distributed a suite of videos and other digital materials on Covid-19 prevention using social media platforms.",positive

"ISLAMABAD: Amid Indus River System Authority (IRSA) anticipating 10 percent shortage of water for irrigation in coming months, the government on Thursday fixed wheat production target at 26.78 million tons for the Rabi (winter) season 2020-21, and decided to provide all out support to agriculture sector, including subsidised fertilisers, pesticides and concessional lending to farmers.

The Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA), which met here with Minister for Food Security and Research Syed Fakhar Imam in chair, fixed wheat production target at 26.78 million ton from 9.16 million hectares area. Last year, wheat production stood at 25.25 million ton against the target of 27.03 million ton.

Fakhar Imam said the prime minister is giving priority to agriculture. He said acquisition of modern agriculture technology, supply of better seeds and balanced use of fertilisers can achieve higher yields. “Our livestock sector is better. Our production is better in paddy and sugarcane, while cotton production is declining due to ball warm and white fly,” he said.

The minister added that now Punjab Seed Corporation is giving only 3 to 5 percent seeds. The minimum support price of wheat will be decided next week and fertiliser will be subsidised. “We are in dire need of increasing wheat production,” he added.

The FCA is a high powered committee which meets twice a year ahead of either of the seasons to fix and review the crop targets. The committee reviewed the estimates for Kharif crops and fixed targets for Rabi season 2020/21. In Pakistan, Kharif cropping season starts from April 01 and end on September 31 and crops in the season include sugarcane, cotton, maize and rice, while Rabi season starts on October 01 and ends on March 31 and its crops are wheat, barley, gram, lentils, potato, onion, tomato etc.

Two major agricultural crops producing provinces -- Punjab and Sindh -- will face the brunt of low availability of irrigation water, but the government officials are satisfied, saying this will not affect the crops production. According to the working paper of FCA meeting, out of 26.78 million tons of wheat production target for Rabi season, Punjab will produce 20 million ton, Sindh 3.95 million ton, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 1.6 million ton and Balochistan 1.22 million ton. Other crops targets were fixed too including gram at 560,000 ton, lentil 8,900 ton, potato 4.87 million ton, onion 2.22 million ton and tomato 625,000 tons.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: Ministry of National Food Security and Research (NFSR) on Thursday claimed that ample wheat stock is available with public sector and plenty is also coming in via import; resultantly there should be no wheat shortage.

The wheat production for this year is 25.249 million metric tons. At the present total hand stocks with public sector are 4.93 million tons. Of this, Punjab having stocks of 2.89 million tons, Sindh 1.26 million tons, KP 88,045 tons, Balochistan 65,082 tons and PASSCO holds 627,173 tons, the Ministry released the data here Thursday. The provincial crop reporting services informed NFSR that there is shortage of 1.6 million tons. Deficit was decided to be met through import of wheat through public, private and G2G basis. State-owned Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) is bringing 217,125 tons of wheat in October in four vessels. In November 180,000 tons of G2G wheat from Russia to reach Pakistan in three ships, while 12 ships will be brought by TCP in December, hauling 600,000 tons of wheat. Similarly in January, 13 more vessels of TCP will arrive at Pakistan with 680,000 tons. Therefore, public sector is bringing in 1.677 million tons of imported staple. NFSR is also planning to augment strategic reserves of wheat to offset any future challenges.

Giving breakup on upcoming cargoes from private sector, the ministry said the country has also received 437,078 tons of imported wheat by private sector in September. In October, six vessels with 360,000 tons of wheat will reach Pakistan. In November, private sector will fetch 180,000 tons of wheat in three ships. In December, two ships carrying 120,000 tons of wheat will arrive to the country. Consequently, private sector will import more than 1 million tons of wheat. The ministry believes that the country will have more than sufficient wheat till January. And claims of wheat shortage are being exploited by vested interest.

On the other hand, the ministry is planning to increase wheat yield through planning in coming years. For this it is focusing on giving better seed to the farmers. Farmers are advised to cultivate maximum area with approved seed to achieve higher yield per acre. NFSR has identified certified wheat seed for first time to make country wheat secure. The Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department (FSC&RD) has certified 5,15000 tons of seed for this year. For back up, FSC&RD has tested 200,000 tones seed from PASSCO. Punjab Food Department has tested 150,000 tones seed for emergency. NFSR has also submitted summary of improved Minimum Support Price (MSP) of wheat to ECC. Coupled with government’s efforts to curb hoarding and smuggling in recent months, the ministry views the situation to improve a lot in coming days.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: Auto sector is all set to bounce back down the line as demand is picking up, while Indus Motor Company (IMC) has resumed double shift production, which was earlier drastically affected by COVID-19, the automaker’s top official said on Thursday.

“Automotive sector foresees a promising future and to be the biggest contributor to the government's macroeconomic goals, provided, a predictable and long term auto policy is in place,” said Ali Asghar Jamali, CEO IMC, while talking to a group of selected journalists at his office.

Jamali said being the largest manufacturing industry, the whole auto sector plunged into a deep crisis during the nationwide lockdown by dint of COVID-19.

“All automakers incurred huge losses and in April not a single vehicle was produced by all three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); however, not a single employee was laid off and we even provided interest free loans to our vendors in line of our commitment to our core value of promoting local engineering base in Pakistan,” he said. The momentum started picking up from July 2020 and due to overwhelming demand, the company went for double-shift production, which would help meet demand and reduce delivery lead time, Jamali said.

“IMC has been striving to meet the expectations of its customers and one of them is the offering earliest delivery to them. We are happy that double-shift production will fulfill our commitment to them,” the IMC CEO said.

It is to be noted that Toyota’s production was well in pace at the start of this calendar year as total production was over 4,000 units in the month of January with a month-on-month increase of around 90 percent. However, owing to the government-imposed lockdown on account of the COVID-19, production remained virtually halted until May 19 when the lockdown eased and ramp up began. Things got far better in September with the production of over 4,300 units.",positive
"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, scheduled to meet today (Wednesday), is likely to allow issuance of RLNG-based CNG licences, as finance, planning, and industries’ ministries have backed the proposal, The News has learnt.

Following the government’s giving private sector a go-ahead to import LNG, the CNG and fertilisers sectors had applied for hiring capacity allocation on terminal-II that has been sitting idle over last couple of years.

In fertiliser sector urea manufacturers including Agritech Ltd and Fatima Fertilizer have applied for availing this facility.

“Yes we have applied and our target is to get this imported source of energy and apart from meeting local demand, we also want to export our products,” an Agritech Ltd official said while talking to The News.

Though he did not give any details, he was confident the company would soon be allocated capacity on terminal-II.

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on petroleum Nadeem Babar, while addressing a conference, organised by a body of CNG industry, had said import of LNG by private sector would reduce the import bill by Rs600 billion.

In a statement, Universal Gas Distribution Company (Private) Limited [UGDC] chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ghayas Paracha said that government could save Rs97 billion during next twelve years by handling 150 mmcfd additional LNG through second LNG terminal.

He appreciated the government for facilitating private sector to import LNG and said the duration of load shedding in winter season would be reduced if private sector was able to import LNG.

Paracha said it would not only help the CNG sector to get an economic boost, but would also enable gas companies to minimise load shedding in winter season.

Petroleum division said the Federal Cabinet in its meeting held on April 12, 2017, while considering a summary submitted by the ministry, had relaxed the moratorium on new gas connection based on RLNG. Therefore, the gas utility companies are now in a position to provide new gas connections, inter alia, to the CNG sector applicants based on the supply of RLNG.

Further, the private sector is now taking up the import of LNG to service the CNG sector and the burden on the government to ensure gas supply to this sector is also shifting. In addition, it is stated that CNG pricing, which was deregulated in 2016 by the government, now determined by market forces.

However, CNG is still cheaper than petrol in terms of MMBTUs.

Keeping in view of the facts stated, the Petroleum Division has proposed that permission to grant new CNG licences or RLNG may be accorded. Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) will incorporate in the ‘ terms and conditions’ that the licence is only for RLNG-based CNG and the licensee cannot claim for its conversion to indigenous gas.",positive
"Two recent women-centric campaigns typify how masculinities are threatened when women challenge norms, prompting reactionary violence. The first was when a group of women journalists alerted a parliamentary committee on human rights to the gender-based profanities and threats of violence that they receive from online trolling. Secondly, a dystopian revenge-plot online series (Churails) with an all-female cast was released, causing anxiety to several male critics. Paradoxically, our cultural defenders dismiss the factual complaints of journalists but consider the fantasy-based, fictional show to be a literal threat to culture and society.  Inevitably, the reaction to any critique of power politics is to discredit the critic as foreign-funded, blasphemous, or motivated by enlightenment-loving liberalism. The simple advice against such puerility is to attend to the content and not the critic.  The backlash to the women journalists’ complaints and Churails is not surprising for those familiar with the pattern of abuse and vitriol directed at those women who dare to hold public office, or broadcast, perform or write subversive content. This is evident in the historical timelines when women entered politics, defied martial laws and protested on the streets, danced at shrines, wrote novels and poetry, played cricket, sat or smoked at dhabas, modelled for fashion or owned their bodies, or marched across cities displaying slogans that spelled out patriarchal practices. Defiance in words and action — at home, schools, offices — results in punitive social action from the gatekeepers of masculinist power and resources.  Gender-based abuse has become a virtual form of violence.  The media is the fourth estate with a duty to monitor state and government excesses, but digital and social media are unregulated neoliberal tools that displace textual analysis or investigative reporting. Govern\xadments use this gap to their advantage to dismiss any critical reports as ‘fake news’. The market comes up with its own ‘corrective’ by way of trolls who muscle out criticism by peddling alternative versions of events and deluging opposing views with curses and threats.  Trolls can be any gender and many have the privilege of an expensive education. But the power differential between men and women, military and civilian, and ruling party and journalists, means there is no level playing field for influencing the narrative.  Where governments sponsor censorship, immunity is inbuilt for trolls (paid or voluntary), who believe they are performing a patriotic duty by silencing dissenters or critics through intimidation and abuse. Where leaders use their power to discredit select women, minorities, journalists and dissenters, they encourage mass bullying. Leaders who deny, deflect or rationalise this violence are complicit.  The internet is lauded as a democratising equaliser but online gender-based abuse has become a virtual form of gratuitous violence where anonymity allows even more cowardly impunity. There are now rescue services being set up for women journalists in some countries after it was found that 40 per cent of online threats directed at women converted into physical violence.  The abusive indignities that Pakistani journalists recounted to the human rights committee echoed the experiences of many women journalists across the world who feel compelled to leave journalism, stop writing, or worst of all, to self-censor or blunt and tame their reports. Govern\xadments should be concerned less with journalistic neutrality and more with the impartial application of media ethics. Respect needs to be a baseline, not a conditional commodity.  Journalists or artists who try to tell the story are becoming the story. The stalking, threats and gender-based slurs are not psychological obstacles which women need to ignore. It is a crisis of masculinity that expresses itself in violent ways. The seeds of every potentially abusive act germinate in intimidation, rumours, ganging up, sexualised insults and sexist jokes.  ‘Churail’ is a polite euphemism for the most common profanity (‘tawaif’) favoured by internet trolls to address women of opposing views. The connection between women, sexuality, the performing arts, perceived treachery, and bodily and economic autonomy is summarised in this expletive. It is an indictment of the journey of Pakistani male respectability that proudly connects its historical lineage and Muslim cultural pre-eminence to the courtly period in Lucknow and which is now reduced to a term that reflects misogyny and political intolerance.",positive
"From the treasure trove of memories I have of the festivals, there is one that never fails to delight my heart. That was recorded at the Children’s Literature Festival held in Turbat in 2018. It was the theatre session in which a bunch of inhibited, shy and reserved youngsters comprised the participants. The resource person was Atif Badar, who struggled to overcome the language barrier with the help of two Balochi teachers. There was also the challenge of drawing the boys out of their apparent reticence.  Atif was directing a play that was to be presented before the chief of army staff. Sociocultural barriers also made the actors nervous as they were required to deliver a dialogue that to many of them must have appeared to be mumbo jumbo — Urdu not being their native language. Then something happened. With prompting from their teachers and the excitement of entering another world, the boys perked up, demonstrating confidence. Atif, who is always encouraging and reassuring as a good teacher should be, got these youngsters to perform a wonderful play, projecting the importance of storytelling and reading. The impromptu actors were wonderful and received a loud ovation from their audience.  Above all, the performers enjoyed the new experience. That is the magic of theatre. That has always attracted Atif to theatre in education which he believes is important to teach children the skill of communication and improve their confidence. He acquired his own skills from Sheema Kermani’s Tehreek-i-Niswan whose contribution to theatre in Pakistan is unmatched. Although he has been teaching theatre for 10 years in some prestigious schools in Karachi, there are few who really appreciate the value of theatre in education. At the most, theatre is equated with the annual play performed on Parents Day in schools. It is not a regular subject used as a tool of learning.  We find it difficult to allow anyone to be unconventional.  Why is theatre so important? Rabindranath Tagore, a major exponent of theatre, dance, music and culture in Bengal, said so many decades ago that in our system students are made to “abhor thinking”. They are not encouraged to analyse the world around them and become agents of the future. They have no capacity to think and understand their own world.  The British philosopher and peace activist Bertrand Russell also suggests that “children should be free citizens of the universe” with the priority being to promote the freedom of the individual, with its tremendous potential for creativity, liberty and its enormous ability to feel and react to the world around us.  Can we in Pakistan ever hope to educate our children in a manner that would really help them change their own future and that of their country? The real building blocks of theatre which captures its essence are theatre games. They liberate the mind and soul of the student. Unfortunately, our approach is too regimented to allow any kind of freedom of thought.  One would wonder how theatre can help in this. To understand what teaching theatre in education really entails, one should read Swatilekha Sengupta’s book title Theatre Games for Schoolchildren. Swatilekha Sengupta is an award-winning theatre practitioner who is a member of Nandikar which is a theatre group in Kolkata. She describes a scene from an activity that her group enacted with children. A little girl sat at the centre and her companions were asked to ready her as they liked to the rhythm of the drumbeat. Without any directions, they combed her hair and dressed her like a bride. That was creativity.  How conformist can we get? We just find it difficult to allow anyone to be unconventional.  I had a lot of fun with children when I was doing voluntary teaching. I had never learnt theatre in my school life and so I had no idea how it was taught. But I could experiment with the idea of creativity. Once I got two children to stage a job interview. It was pretty interesting and the questions posed were quite ingenious such as the boss asking, “What will your children do when you work?”  This reminded me of my job interview with the editor of Dawn, Ahmad Ali Khan, when I sat before him as a nervous young mother in 1975, hiding my jitters behind my bravado. The questions were not the usual conventional ones about my qualifications but my children. Yet the interview was a success for I remained in the newspaper for over 33 years. I do wonder sometimes if Khan Sahib had ever played ‘interview interview’ in his childhood. I hadn’t.",positive
"The sit-in paralysed life in Islamabad. A half-hearted attempt by the police to push back the protesters failed. Meanwhile, travel from and to Islamabad became impossible. Those trying to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi for Lahore found access to the Motorway and GT Road blocked. No policeman or traffic warden was visible to indicate the authorities’ interest in clearing the traffic. In the absence of mobile services, the people had no means of reaching the authorities.  Most of the ministers were busy at the TV station celebrating the PTI’s victory in the Gilgit-Baltistan elections and the ‘defeat of Nawaz Sharif’s narrative’. They had no time for ordinary citizens’ travail. All of a sudden, the prime minister realised something was wrong and recalled that he had a religious affairs’ minister in his cabinet. But the minister concerned was cooling his heels about 300 kilometres from the trouble spot. Allah be praised for the prime minister’s memory that he thought of the religious affairs’ minister and asked him to negotiate a settlement with the TLP. The whole thing depended on the prime minister’s initiative and one was convinced of the benefits of one-man rule.  At this point, the narrative takes a sudden turn. The earlier narrative suggested that the religious affairs’ minister, Noorul Haq Qadri, met Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the TLP chief, and the latter agreed to call off the agitation. Later on, it was revealed that the government had signed an agreement with the TLP similar to the one signed after the 2017 dharna. Indeed, the TLP chief declared that the government conceded all of their demands. Even if this interpretation is not shared by the government, the feeling of elation in the TLP means it has rightly identified the areas of the government’s vulnerability and will soon return because it is playing for high stakes.  It is time the government considered the desirability of pursuing the Quaid’s ideal of a democratic polity.  Perhaps the government did not fully appreciate the TLP plan of action. The party was enlarging its area of operations by staging a political manoeuvre under a religious banner. It must have known that the government would not allow it to march on the French embassy and one wonders whether it seriously wanted to go that far. All it probably wanted to demonstrate was the inadequacy by its reckoning of the government’s response to the French provocation and use this incident to challenge the government’s bona fides in its claim to be working for the establishment of an Islamic state.  The inescapable fact is that the government’s own rhetoric about establishing an ideal Islamic state by discarding the model set by the first four caliphs has emboldened quite a few elements to chart new paths to the Muslim people’s glory. Already a few of these elements are asserting their privilege to define their version of true Islam on the strength of arms in their possession. Although the government’s inclusion of people’s welfare in its definition of an Islamic state sets it apart from the advocates of traditional Muslim politics, it lacks the backing of sufficient scholars to be able to hold its ground against attacks from the traditionalists.  It is therefore time the government seriously considered the desirability of pursuing Quaid-i-Azam’s ideal of a democratic polity and allowed all citizens to adopt and practise whatever religious belief appeals to their mind. Any other course will put the state at risk of dangerous attacks from what in fact are seekers of political power in religious garb.  Pakistan’s politicians have often been warned against playing on the religious parties’ turf because of the latter’s ability to interpret religio-political texts to their advantage. The way they have succeeded in popularising their interpretation of the Objectives Resolution is an example. The policy of appeasing the conservative religious lobby followed by successive governments has made the task of regaining ground for democratic politics more difficult, but the larger interests of the state and the people prohibit any other course.  The unnecessary and hazardous pursuit of populist politics has played no small part in persuading Pakistan’s politicians to pander to the citizens’ religious sensibilities that are often allowed high premium. The small percentage of votes received by purely faith-based platforms in successive elections establishes the people’s preference for an egalitarian order. The obvious lesson for politicians is to avoid giving exaggerated space to belief in political matters.  Pakistan needs to take a critical look at the movement in Muslim states from religious orientation towards nationalism, a course that has many pitfalls. Further, there is, for instance, a school of thought that challenges the very expression ‘Islamic state’ as being at variance with the spirit of Islam which puts a high premium on voluntary choice of faith. This is being said only to underline the possibility that the state of Pakistan might be seeking accommodation with a traditional version of belief at a time when such adjustments are perceived as obsolete. Thus the government’s accord with TLP might appear as an attempt to recreate a past that is distant.  Tailpiece: The Gilgit-Baltistan electorate has a tradition of voting for the party in power in Islamabad. Judged from this perspective the result of last Sunday’s election should cause anxiety among the PTI high command instead of jubilation. The success of as many independent candidates as PTI ticket holders does not reveal as much of PTI’s sway over the GB population as government spokesmen are claiming. However, the right of party activists to interpret facts as they wish is deeply entrenched in Pakistan politicss",positive
"This should be taken as the beginning of an operation to extend relief primarily to women prisoners, and to male detainees as well — the benefit of the Supreme Court’s relief package as given last April. The court made the following recommendations for the release of prisoners:  “Under-trial prisoners: Accused persons charged for offences under non-prohibitory clauses or under vagrancy law or offences carrying less than three years sentence may be considered for bail subject to the following: (a) the benefit shall not extend in cases involving abuse/violent acts against children and women; (b) benefit shall first be extended to persons otherwise suffering from ailments or physical or mental disability; (c) benefit shall be extended to UTPs who are 55 years of age or older and then other male UTPs provided there is no history of past convictions; (d) benefit shall be extended to all women/ juvenile UTPs.  “Bail in the above cases may be extended on personal bond.  “Convicts: The following categories of convicted persons may be considered for release by the provincial governments under Section 401 CrPC. (a) Convicts who have otherwise completed their sentences but remain in jail on account of non-payment off line/monetary penalty; (b) Women/juvenile convicts who have completed 75 per cent of their sentence and have no history of past convictions; (c) Convicts whose remaining term in jail is six months or less provided offence was not violence against women or children; (d) Women/juveniles who were sentenced to a term of one year or less.”  The steps suggested by the apex court are necessary to mitigate the suffering of prisoners.  The whole scheme of relief to under-trial prisoners and convicts was suggested by the attorney general, and must have been known to the government. So far the prime minister has announced plans to release women prisoners who are detained because of non-payment of fine. However, the Supreme Court recommendations have set an agenda for relief to prisoners on a large scale.  It is much to be hoped that all provincial governments will give priority to implementation of the Supreme Court’s proposals. The steps suggested by the apex court are necessary to mitigate the suffering of the prison population caused by the tradition of denying bail on a large scale and allowing it in few cases.  The prime minister has also instructed the authorities to draw up plans for improving prison conditions and there is tremendous scope for overhauling the entire prison system as it has deteriorated hugely over the past several decades.  Pakistan’s prison rules were last revised in the light of UN Standard Minimum Rules drawn up in the 1960s. These rules were revised in 2015 and are now called the Mandela Rules. Under these rules and principles the difference between incarceration and freedom has been drastically reduced and the powers of prison administration to care for sick prisoners vastly increased. The need for bringing prison rules in accord with the Mandela Rules cannot be overemphasised.  Even more urgent is the need to improve upon the system developed during the colonial period and sustained during the early decades of independence. Under this system, prisoners were afforded full opportunities to become law-abiding citizens by improving their educational qualifications. These educational facilities need to be revived and their quality continually improved. While all central jails may offer instruction up to Matric level, some, say one in each division, may offer instruction in higher courses and vocational training.  More importantly, the scheme for enabling prisoners to learn crafts, such as carpet weaving, blanket making, carpentry, etc, needs to be revived. There was a time that the entire furniture for the prison department was produced at the Bahawalpur jail and the blankets made at Jhang jail enjoyed good sales in Lahore’s Anarkali bazaar. Pakistan’s first radio-set-making unit was set up at Kot Lakhpat jail. These activities enabled the prisoners to acquire skills that helped them rehabilitate themselves in society after release and also helped push the crime rate down.  By the time the colonial power withdrew in 1947, a number of initiatives had been taken to modernise and humanise the treatment of criminals and prisoners. The idea of open jails had been developed and two such jails were established on Pakistan territories at Manawan in Punjab and Badin in Sindh. Neither became functional. Kot Lakhpat jail too was originally planned as an open jail.  It will be said that the country is no longer dealing with ordinary criminals and that we are now in the age of multinational terrorism and therefore we cannot afford idealistic theories. The argument is only half valid. All that the present situation demands is full security around prisons without a descent into cruelty inside the detention centres. Besides, emergency-driven policies cannot be accepted as all-time guidelines.  What is needed by way of reform in the theory and practice of maintaining prison houses is a new definition of imprisonment. The present meaning of depriving a person of liberty is limited to punishing him for what society considers to be a wrong and punishable act. He is therefore obliged to give up all social contacts with the people many of whom are capable of exercising benevolent influence upon him, and join a motley crowd whose members are known for a variety of crimes, from petty larceny to anything short of manslaughter. The prisoner is humiliated to an extent that he loses any sense of the dignity of person. This prison system ensures that in most cases a first-time offender becomes over a short period a hardened criminal.  A better alternative is to turn the prisons into reformatories where the detainees can discover their inherent goodness and become responsible members of society.",positive
"SAN FRANCISCO: Google added an earthquake alert system in California on Tuesday, saying it is working on allowing Android-powered smartphones to work as tremor detectors.  Android phones will receive warnings triggered by a ""ShakeAlert"" earthquake early-warning system implemented on the West Coast by the US Geological Survey and partners.  ShakeAlert uses signals from hundreds of seismometers across the state to trigger warning messages that ""an earthquake has begun and shaking is imminent,"" according to the system\'s website.  ""We saw an opportunity to use Android to provide people with timely, helpful earthquake information when they search, as well as a few seconds warning to get themselves and their loved ones to safety if needed,"" principal software engineer Marc Stogaitis said in a blog post.  People anywhere with smartphones powered by Google\'s Android operating software were also invited to let handsets be part of a crowd-sourced network for detecting earthquakes.  Smartphones are typically equipped with tiny accelerometers that sense movement and can catch shaking caused by earthquakes, according to Stogaitis.  ""This means your Android phone can be a mini seismometer, joining millions of other Android phones out there to form the world\'s largest earthquake detection network,"" Stogaitis said.  Android phones that detect what might be earthquake activity can automatically send a signal to a data center, where computers quickly interpret motion and location data in aggregate to determine whether a quake is happening, according to Google.  ""We\'re essentially racing the speed of light — which is roughly the speed at which signals from a phone travel — against the speed of an earthquake,"" Stogaitis said.  ""And lucky for us, the speed of light is much faster!""  Earthquake alerts are starting in California because the state has an extensive seismometer network in place. The alerts are expected to spread to other locations during the coming year as the phone-based detection network is established.  Fault-lines in the earth under California make it prime earthquake territory, and residents here are routinely warned of the inevitability of the next ""big one.""  Meanwhile, a shallow 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit North Carolina on Sunday, shaking buildings in the biggest tremor in the area for more than 100 years.  Major earthquakes are relatively rare on the US east coast.",positive
"SAN FRANCISCO: Google added an earthquake alert system in CKARACHI: TikTok has updated its community guidelines to make them available in Urdu for its fans in Pakistan, the company said Thursday, just two weeks after representatives of the Chinese-owned video-sharing app and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) had a back-and-forth over ""obscene"" content.  The PTA had earlier issued a final warning to the social media firm on July 21 and asked it ""to moderate the socialisation and content within legal and moral limits, in accordance with the laws of the country"".  In a press release today, it said providing the community guidelines in Urdu was aimed at helping ""maintain a supportive and welcoming environment for its Pakistan users"" in a bid to offer more space for fun and creative expression as it becomes increasingly popular in the country.  ""Addressing this, TikTok has released an updated publication of the Community Guidelines in Urdu that will help and maintain a supportive and welcoming environment on TikTok for users in Pakistan,"" the company said.  It underscored that the community guidelines provide its guidance on ""what is and what is not allowed on the platform, keeping TikTok a safe place for creativity and joy, and are localized and implemented in accordance with local laws and norms"".  ""TikTok’s teams remove content that violates the Community Guidelines, and suspends or bans accounts involved in severe or repeated violations.  ""Content moderation is performed by deploying a combination of policies, technologies, and moderation strategies to detect and review problematic content, accounts, and implement appropriate penalties,"" it added.  Pakistan one of top markets with most removed videos The Chinese app also pointed out that Pakistan, according to its latest transparency report, was ""one of the top 5 markets with the largest volume of removed videos on TikTok for violating community guidelines or terms of service"".  ""This demonstrates TikTok’s commitment to remove any potentially harmful or inappropriate content reported in Pakistan.""  TikTok said its systems were set up in such a way that they could automatically flag certain types of content that violated the community guidelines, ""enabling it to take swift action and reduce potential harm"".  ""These systems take into account things like patterns or behavioural signals to flag potentially violative content,"" it added.  Content moderation Citing a lack of advancement in technology to enforce its policies, it underlined that ""context can be important when determining whether certain content, like satire, is violative"".  ""In some cases, this team removes evolving or trending violative content, such as dangerous challenges or harmful misinformation,"" it said.

"BEIJING: The founder of Bytedance, which owns social media giant TikTok, said Monday his teams were working around-the-clock ""for the best outcome,"" as talks on the sale of its US operation to Microsoft continue, Chinese media reported.  TikTok, popular in the United States and widely used by young people who create, share and watch short videos on the platform — is the latest target in a wide-ranging trade war between Beijing and Washington.   The US government has said the Chinese-owned company is a national security threat — allegations that TikTok denies.  ""In the current environment, we faced the real possibility of a forced sale of TikTok\'s US business... or an executive order banning the app,"" ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming wrote in a message to all the company\'s staff, tech news outlet Pandaily reported.

The tech giant added it aimed to wrap up discussions ""no later than September 15.""  President Donald Trump said last week he would ban the app, but since appears to have backed away from the threat, which caused great concern for US users — particularly content creators who make money on the platform.  Many have posted links to their Instagram or YouTube accounts to avoid losing followers if the platform is ultimately blocked.  Zhang said he disagreed with forcing TikTok to offload its US service.

"NEW YORK: Apple on Wednesday became the first US company to reach $2 trillion in market value in the latest demonstration of how tech giants have benefited from the upheaval of the coronavirus.  The iPhone maker attained the distinction in mid-morning trading and was up 1.1 percent at $467.18 near 1545 GMT. The company had previously become the first giant to hit $1 trillion in market value in March 2018.  Apple is followed by other technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, all of which now have more than $1 trillion in market value.  Shares in Apple have roughly doubled from March lows, an astonishing performance which has lifted chief executive Tim Cook´s net worth to $1 billion for the first time, according to a Bloomberg Billionaires Index calculation.  Even as other large tech firms have shot higher on robust demand during lockdowns, Apple has outpaced its rivals by delivering strong sales of gadgetry including wearables and tablets, along with new apps and services which have gained ground during the global health crisis.  ""Apple has been wildly successful in building out its platforms, mitigating the fact that iPhone sales had peaked, by building products that surround it and services that enhance it,"" said Avi Greengart, analyst with the consultancy Techsponential.  ""It all feeds back into the cycle for Apple.""  In the past quarter ending in June, Apple reported profits climbed eight percent to $11.2 billion and revenues jumped 11 percent to $59.7 billion.  Work-from-home A major factor in Apple´s success has been leadership from Cook, who took over just ahead of the death of Steve Jobs in 2011.  ""He didn´t invent anything, but what he has done is keep a firm hand on the tiller, steering the ship and keeping the culture intact,"" said analyst Laura Martin at Needham & Company.  ""He deserves a lot of credit for making the most out of Steve Jobs´s inventions.""  Apple´s rise comes amid a broader rally in technology shares as employees around the country shift to working at home amid the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing protocols.  The tech-rich Nasdaq has hit records more than 30 times in 2020, including on Tuesday.  In the most recent quarter, Apple enjoyed a modest rise in smartphone revenue and robust increases in sales of iPads and Mac computers amid elevated demand for remote education and work-from-home buyers.  The company also benefited from services such as digital payments and streaming and from increased sales in smartwatches as interest in health and fitness applications rises.  Success brings scrutiny The ascendancy of Apple and other tech giants has prompted increased oversight from regulators and lawmakers, including on Capitol Hill, where Cook and the CEOs from Amazon, Facebook and Google all were grilled at a high-profile July 29 hearing.  ""Simply put, they have too much power,"" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel that convened the hearing.  During the session, Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of the company´s App Store and its treatment of developers.  Analysts expect more scrutiny ahead for Apple and the other giants, but it isn´t clear yet whether the questioning will lead to meaningful change.  Some analysts believe efforts to break up tech giants or otherwise reign them in could gain momentum if Democrats sweep the 2020 elections.  Another wildcard for Apple involves risks from heightened tensions between the United States and China, since Apple not only manufactures iPhones and other products there, but also relies on that market for a large chunk of sales, Greengart noted.  US President Donald Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Beijing through restrictions on leading Chinese tech firms. Any retaliation against Washington by China could cause troubles for Apple, analysts say.",positive
"AFP September 18, 2020  HomeLatestSci-Tech Apple announces to open first online store in India next week  Its renewed push into India comes as Asia\'s third-largest economy has hit a record slump due to a months-long coronavirus lockdown. — AFP/Files MUMBAI: Apple said Friday it will launch its first online store in India next week, in a bid to cash in on New Delhi\'s festive season and grow its tiny share of the booming market.  The company is a small player in India, where sales of its smartphones lag those of South Korean rival Samsung, with the iPhone maker pricing itself exclusively at the luxury end of the market.   Its renewed push into India comes as Asia\'s third-largest economy has hit a record slump due to a months-long coronavirus lockdown.  India\'s busiest shopping season usually kicks off in October, with stores offering steep discounts and freebies to customers looking to splurge on big-ticket items as they celebrate popular Hindu festivals including Dussehra and Diwali.  Apple\'s online store, which will open for business on September 23, will offer ""a range of affordability options"" including discounts on Macs, iPads and tech accessories for students, the company said in a press release.  Shoppers will be able to get their AirPods, iPads and Apple Pencils engraved in English, Hindi and a range of other Indian languages.  Apple currently sells through third-party retailers in India including Amazon, and the country is seen as a huge potential market for the firm due to its giant 1.3-billion population and relatively low number of smartphone owners.  The company has only a two-percent share of the Indian market, according to industry estimates.  An application to open Apple Stores in India in 2016 was reportedly rebuffed because of a rule that states foreign retailers must source 30 percent of their products locally.  New Delhi has since relaxed the rules, giving companies up to eight years to meet the sourcing requirements, as part of a push to attract foreign investment and create jobs.  Some of its smartphones, including the iPhone 11, are assembled at facilities operated by Taiwanese manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron in the southern Indian cities of Chennai and Bangalore.",positive

"LAGOS: The World Health Organisation (WHO) is expected to certify on Tuesday that the African continent has gotten rid of the polio, four years after the last cases appeared in northeastern Nigeria.  ""Thanks to the relentless efforts by governments, donors, frontline health workers and communities, up to 1.8 million children have been saved from the crippling life-long paralysis,"" the WHO said in a statement.  The official announcement is due at 1500 GMT in a videoconference with WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and key figures including philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.  ""Happiness is an understatement. We\'ve been on this marathon for over 30 years,"" said Tunji Funsho, a Nigerian doctor and local anti-polio coordinator for Rotary International.  He said it marked a crucial step in the total eradication of the illness at the global level.  ""It\'s a real achievement, I feel joy and relief at the same time,"" he added.  Poliomyelitis, or ""wild polio"" is an acutely infectious and contagious disease which attacks the spinal cord and causes irreversible paralysis in children.  It was endemic around the world until a vaccine was found in the 1950s, though this remained out of reach for many poorer countries in Asia and Africa.  As late as 1988, the WHO counted 350,000 cases globally, and in 1996 said there were more than 70,000 cases in Africa alone.  Thanks to a rare instance of collective global effort and financial backing — some $19 billion over 30 years — only Afghanistan and Pakistan have recorded cases this year: 87 in total.  Trust  Nigeria, a country with 200 million inhabitants, was still among the trouble-spots in the early 2000s.  In its northern Muslim-majority areas, authorities were forced to stop vaccination campaigns in 2003 and 2004 by militants who claimed it was a vast conspiracy to sterilise young Muslims.  It took a huge effort in tandem with traditional chiefs and religious leaders to convince populations that the vaccine was safe.  ""People trust their local traditional leaders who live with them more than the political leaders,"" said Grema Mundube, a community leader in the town of Monguno, in the far north of Nigeria.  ""Once we spoke to them and they saw us immunising our children they gradually accepted the vaccine,"" he told AFP.  However, the emergence of violent Islamist group Boko Haram in 2009 caused another rupture in the programme. In 2016, four new cases were discovered in Borno state in the northeast in the heart of the conflict.  ""At the time, we couldn\'t reach two-thirds of the children of Borno state — 400,000 children couldn\'t access the vaccine,"" said Dr Funsho.  Inaccessible children  The security situation remains highly volatile in the region, with the militants of Boko Haram and a local Islamic State affiliate controlling vast areas around Lake Chad and the border with Niger.  ""International agencies, local governments, donors — all partners took the bull by the horns to find new strategies to manage to reach these children,"" said Dr Musa Idowu Audu, coordinator for the WHO in Borno.  In these ""partially accessible"" areas, vaccination teams worked under the protection of the Nigerian army and local self-defence militias.  For areas fully controlled by the militants, the WHO and its partners sought to intercept people coming in and out along market and transport routes in a bid to spread medical information and recruit ""health informants"" who could tell them about any polio cases.  ""We built a pact of trust with these populations, for instance by giving them free medical supplies,"" said Dr Audu.  Today, it is estimated that only 30,000 children are still ""inaccessible"": a number considered too low by scientists to allow for an epidemic to break out.  Despite the ""extreme happiness and pride"" felt by Dr Audu, he never fails to remember the 20 or more medical staff and volunteers killed for the cause in northeast Nigeria in recent years.  The challenge now is to ensure that no new polio cases arrive from Afghanistan or Pakistan and that vaccinations continue to ensure that children across the continent are protected from this vicious disease.  ""Before we couldn\'t sleep at all. Now we will sleep with one eye open,"" said Dr Funsho.",positive
"AFP August 20, 2020  HomeLatestHealth Diabetic patients may find ray of hope in stem cell treatment  WHO says around 422 million people worldwide were living with diabetes by 2014. Photo: File TOKYO:  Diabetic patients may find a treatment after scientists developed a new technique that grows insulin-producing cells and can protect them from immune attack after they are transplanted.  In type-1 diabetes, the body turns on itself and attacks the so-called beta cells inside clusters in the pancreas called ""islets"".   These beta cells are responsible for gauging sugar levels in the blood and releasing insulin to keep them stable. Without them, diabetics must rely on insulin injections or pumps.  One treatment devised to end that reliance involves transplanting donor islets into diabetics, but the process is complicated by several obstacles, including a shortage of donors.  Islets also often fail to connect with blood supply, and even when they do, like other transplants, they can come under attack by the recipient\'s immune system, which views the cells as invaders.  As a result, patients have to take drugs that suppress their immune systems, protecting their transplant but potentially exposing the rest of their body to illness.  In a bid to overcome some of these challenges, a team looked to find another source for islets, by coaxing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) to produce what the team called HILOs, or human islet-like organoids.  These HILOs, when grown in a 3D environment mimicking the pancreas and then turbocharged with a ""genetic switch"", successfully produced insulin and were able to regulate blood glucose when transplanted into diabetic mice.  ""In the past, this functionality was only achieved after a month-long maturation in a living animal,"" said Ronald Evans, director of the Gene Expression Lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.  ""This breakthrough allows for the production of functional HILOs which are active on the first day of transplantation, placing us closer to clinical applications,"" Evans, who led the study, told AFP.  Giving hope  Having found a potential way to solve the supply chain problem, the scientists then sought to tackle the issue of immune rejection.  They focused on something called PD-L1, a so-called checkpoint protein that is known to inhibit the body\'s immune response.  In cancer treatments, medication is sometimes used to block PD-L1, boosting the body\'s immune response to cancer cells.  The team effectively reversed that process, and induced the HILOs to express the protein in a bid to outwit the immune system.  ""Normally, human cells placed in a mouse would be eliminated within a day or two,"" said Evans.  ""We discovered a way to create an immune shield that makes human cells invisible to the immune system.""  While HILOs transplanted into mice without the PD-L1 protection gradually stopped functioning, those induced to express the protein were shielded and continued to help diabetic mice regulate their blood glucose for more than 50 days.  Being able to grow insulin-producing cells and protect them from attack ""brings us much closer to having a potential therapy for type-1 diabetic patients,"" Evans said.  Around 422 million people worldwide were living with diabetes by 2014, according to the World Health Organization, a figure that includes both type-1 and type-2 diabetes.  Islet transplantation is generally considered as a treatment for type-1 diabetics, whose disease is the result of an auto-immune response.  Evans cautioned that the research, already a decade in the making, was still years from being able to treat diabetes in humans.  ""To advance HILOs into the clinic, we need to confirm that they work in other animal models, including primates, as well as do longer-term studies in mice,"" he said.  He hopes that human studies of the technique will be possible in two to five years.  ""This is a hard-to-manage disease and insulin is not a cure,"" he added, noting that 1.6 million children and teenagers are living with type-1 diabetes in the United States alone.  ""Good science is not just a discovery — it can enrich the world and give hope to those who live with disease.""",positive
"MOSCOW: Russia hopes to complete trials of a coronavirus vaccine in August and produce 200 million doses with foreign partners by the end  of the year, the head of its sovereign wealth fund said Monday.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which manages some $10 billion, is working with a government research institute on one of several vaccine projects in the country.  RDIF chief executive Kirill Dmitriev said he hoped the project would receive permission next month to begin production, after the first phase of a vaccine trial was completed last week.  ""Immediately after that we are planning to begin mass production,"" Dmitriev said in a statement on Russia\'s state anti-coronavirus portal.  ""Mass production of this vaccine can stop the pandemic\'s potential \'second wave\',"" he said.  He said Russia would be in a position to produce 30 million doses of the vaccine by year\'s end, with ""international partners across the world"" joining in to bring the total to 200 million.  The Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology\'s vaccine is undergoing trials on military and civilian volunteers.  It is based on human adenovirus, a cold virus. Dmitriev said the second phase of the trial will be over by August 3.  ""After that, a third phase of trials will begin in Russia and several countries,"" he said, adding that Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and others would be involved.  He said that adenoviral vector-based vaccines had been developed since the 1980s and are generally safe.  Dmitriev, 45, said he himself had been vaccinated and had developed ""stable immunity"" 20 days after the first shot.  Last week Britain, the United States and Canada said a hacking group ""almost certainly"" linked to Russian intelligence had carried out attacks aimed at stealing vaccine research, a claim denied by Moscow.",positive

"LONDON: A Manchester private hire businessman is highlighting the issue of Indian occupied Kashmir by wrapping his vehicles with “Kashmiri Lives Matter” posters.  British-born Mohammed Rafqat owns around 100 private hire cars which operate in the Greater Manchester area, providing taxi and delivery services.  The businessman has wrapped his vehicles with slogans of Kashmiri Lives Matter; India! Stop Genocide in Kashmir; and End Indian occupation of Kashmir. Rest of the posters highlight the count of loss of human life inflicted on Kashmiris by the Indian occupation forces. These posters give the account of over 100,000 innocent Kashmiris who have lost their lives at the hands of Indian forces.  Speaking to Geo and The News, Mohammed Rafqat said he hoped that thousands of people would be able to see these posters displayed on his vehicles.  He explained: “My cars operate in Manchester and the surrounding areas and I hope that everyday thousands of people watch these cars passing by. The whole point is to show to English community and others that Kashmiri Lives Matter too.”  Rafaqat said he took the initiative after realising that awareness about the issues of Kashmir either lacked in western countries or people in the west didn’t know much about the conflict.  He said his campaign is simply focussed on the sufferings of common people. “I don’t belong to any political party. I am concerned only about the people of Kashmir. They are victims of Indian genocide and the world is looking away.”  The businessman was inspired by the recent campaign under the banner of “Black Lives Matter”. dozens of protests were held across cities in Britain including in Manchester. These protests brought together people from all shades under the same banner.  “I liked the messaging of Black Lives Matter movement. It was all about the rights of Black people and it was simple and effective. I decided to launch vehicles for the same purpose of reaching out to maximum number of people to show them there is a forgotten place called Kashmiri where India is involved in state terrorism by usurping rights of innocent people.”  Rafaqat’s vehicles have grabbed attention in busy areas of Manchester. Locals have stopped by to read the wording of posters. Outside the train station, passengers have stopped to make pictures of his vehicles to post on social media sites. Teenagers have stopped by Rafqat’s cars to make selfies.  Rafqat didn’t disclose how much he has spent to decorate his cars with “Kashmiri Lives Matter” posters but he said the money was not the issue.  He said: “I am prepared to spend as much as I can. I will do anything for my people in Kashmir. I have answered the call of my conscience. This campaign is all about humanity, the humanity of Kashmiri people which India has denied to them.”",positive
"RIYADH: G20 nations declared Friday a ""common framework"" for an extended debt restructuring plan for coronavirus-ravaged developing countries, but campaigners cautioned that more was needed to alleviate a ""wave of debt crises"".  G20 nations last month agreed a six-month extension to a debt suspension initiative until June next year, falling short of calls by the World Bank and campaigners for a full-year renewal.  The framework, also agreed by the Paris Club of creditor countries, goes beyond that initiative to reschedule or reduce debts of vulnerable nations on a ""case-by-case approach"", G20 finance ministers and central bankers said.  ""In principle, debt treatments will not be conducted in the form of debt write-off or cancellation,"" they said in a statement following a virtual meeting hosted by the current G20 president Saudi Arabia.  ""If, in the most difficult cases, debt write-off or cancellation is necessary... specific consideration will be given to the fact that each participating creditor shall fulfill its domestic approval procedures in a timely manner.""  French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire hailed the agreement on the framework as ""historic"".  ""For the first time, all the main bilateral creditors, members or non-members of the Paris Club, will coordinate the debt treatment of the low income countries,"" Le Maire said.  ""It will bring more transparency in the debt relief process and involve private creditors, who will need to commit to at least comparable terms.""  A senior US Treasury official said ""the scale of the pandemic crisis"" and the ""deteriorating outlook"" in many low-income countries had warranted the need for extended debt relief.  Seventy-three countries are eligible to have their debt restructured, including 38 in sub-Saharan Africa.  \'Breathing space\' The agreement marks a major step for China, a top creditor to poor countries that officials say has resisted attempts to write off debts.  Over the past two decades, China has financed projects in developing nations, including as part of its Belt and Road Initiative to build infrastructure to further expand trade.  The Treasury official blamed Chinese creditors for ""a lack of full participation"" and transparency.  ""We have a political commitment to this common framework going forward,"" the official said.  ""But we certainly will be monitoring closely exactly how it works in practice. And with a particular eye on Chinese participation.""  Warning of a looming debt crisis across poverty-wracked developing nations, campaigners said the framework was far from sufficient.  ""This announcement falls far short of what is needed to tackle the wave of debt crises in poorer countries,"" said Tim Jones, head of policy at Jubilee Debt Campaign, a British charity.  ""With many countries facing debt crises... the G20 need to stop kicking the can down the road and build a transparent and inclusive system for cancelling debts to a sustainable level across private, bilateral and multilateral lenders.""  Last month, the World Bank said the debt of the world\'s 73 poorest countries grew 9.5 percent last year to a record $744 billion.  The countries\' debt burden owed to government creditors, most of whom are G20 states, reached $178 billion last year, and China is owed more than 63 percent of that.  ""The debt service suspension initiative has provided much needed \'breathing space\' to countries,"" said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.  ""But there are countries where debt levels are not sustainable. This is where the timely common framework comes into play — a coordinated approach to debt treatment, a standardised approach, but with case-by-case resolution.""  Georgieva said it was ""critically important"" to bring the private sector on board.  In a letter to G20 chair Saudi Arabia, the Washington-based Institute of International Finance said private creditors were ready to take part in the extended debt relief initiative, but so far they have received few requests from eligible countries.",positive

"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has finally congratulated Joe Biden for his victory in the US presidential election, and called for better ties between both countries.  Erdogan\'s statement came a full three days after US media called the election in Biden\'s favour, underscoring the close personal bond the Turkish leader enjoyed with Trump.  But Ankara and Washington also experienced tensions during Trump\'s four years in office, including over US support for a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey views as a grave security threat.  ""I congratulate you on your election success and convey my sincere wishes for the peace and welfare of the US people,"" Erdogan said in a statement published by his office, urging ""strong cooperation"" between the sides.

"The Afghan cricket team presented a signed bat to Prime Minister Imran Khan on the premier\'s maiden visit to Afghanistan, the Prime Minister\'s Office said Thursday.  PM Imran Khan, a cricketer-turned-politician, was the Pakistani captain who had led the country to victory during the 1992 World Cup.  During his visit, the prime minister said that Pakistan would do its utmost best to end violence and establish peace in Afghanistan, as he held a press conference alongside Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.  ""The people and government of Pakistan have only one concern, and that is to establish peace in Afghanistan because the people of the country have suffered for four decades.""  He said that even though Pakistan played its role in getting the Taliban to talk to the Americans, as well as engage them in the intra-Afghan dialogue, the level of violence has been on a rise in the country.  PM Imran Khan assured the Afghanistan government that Pakistan is ready to help the country in every possible way to attain peace.

In this sense the rule of law is contrasted with every system of government based on the exercise by persons in authority of wide, arbitrary, or discretionary powers of constraint.” Exercise of executive power without the sanction of a law made by the legislature is illegal if it affects anyone’s rights, be it to property, reputation or personal liberty. The order was made mala fide to debar politicians who disagree with official policy. It is not based on any law. The order is designed to curtail dissenting politicians’ rights. Forty years ago, the supreme court ruled (6-1) in ‘Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India’ that the right to travel abroad is integral to personal liberty. Article 21 confers this fundamental right on all citizens and aliens: “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.” The court overruled its earlier view that any law sufficed. To be valid, the law must: (a) comply with the other rights including the rights to freedom of speech and expression and to assemble peaceably without arms; (b) must be a fair procedure; and (c) the rules of natural justice apply, ie a person must be heard before his passport is denied or revoked. Over the years, this ruling has acquired respect bordering on veneration. But every single rule it laid down has been violated in Kaloo’s case. In Maneka’s case, there was a law (Passports Act, 1967) however inadequate and arbitrary. In Kaloo’s case there was none, only the whim of the CID and its bosses in Delhi. Vendetta governed both cases. Maneka’s husband Sanjay Gandhi behaved like a lout during the Emergency. She acquired a valid passport in June 1976. In the 1977 general election, the opposition Janata Party came to power. In July 1977, her passport was impounded and she was asked to surrender it. No reasons were assigned. The court further held: “Could it have been intended by the constitution-makers that a citizen should have this freedom in India but not outside? Freedom of speech and expression carries with it the right to gather information as also to speak and express oneself at home and abroad and to exchange thoughts and ideas with others not only in India but also outside. On what principle of construction and for what reason can this freedom be confined geographically within the limits of India? The constitution-makers have not chosen to limit the extent of this freedom by adding the words ‘in the territory of India’ at the end of Article 19(1)(a). They have deliberately refrained from using any words of limitation. Then, are we going to supply these words and narrow down the scope and ambit of a highly cherished fundamental right? Let us not forget that what we are expounding is a constitution and what we are called upon to interpret is a provision conferring a fundamental right. Shall we expand its reach and ambit or curtail it?” The court referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A year later, in 1979, India ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 12 of which reads: “(i) Everyone lawfully within the territory of a state shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence; (ii) Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own; (iii) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.” States that are party to the ICCPR periodically file country reports. Over the years a body of case law developed, which was compiled.

"Morality has apparently been ripped to shreds. In a frankly patriarchal desert culture where local women wear the niqab, what was unthinkable has happened. Still, no internal protest has been reported and neighbouring countries don’t care. Other GCC countries — and even normally hostile Turkey — have not commented. Saudi Arabia, once a bastion of Sunni conservatism, is following a similar path. Theocratic Iran semi-officially admits its alcohol problem and seems resigned. Billboards in Tehran warn against drinking and driving. No Arab Spring movement is driving this cultural liberalisation nor is popular democracy on the cards. Unless something happens, dynastic rulers and clerics will continue to rule. Various new top-down changes simply aim at making Arab countries more Western tourist and business friendly. The recent opening up to Israel undoubtedly plays some part. Pakistan seeks to lead the Muslim world but civil society in the Middle East is evolving much faster. But the new legislative changes freeing cultural behaviour are likely to impact society far more than political changes. They bring with them many key questions: what is sinful and improper and what does Islam forbid or permit? Which values are truly permanent and absolute and which must inevitably change with time? Notions of right and wrong are being turned upside down everywhere. There is, for example, complete acceptance now of television across the Muslim world. Even in Pakistan — among the most conservative Islamic countries — families spend evenings glued to the drawing room TV set. Men with beards and women from Al Huda casually snap selfies and WhatsApp them around. Yet older citizens cannot forget admonitions that Islam prohibits photography and the strident denunciations of TV as a ‘shaitani ala’ (devil’s tool). Aniconism, or a prohibition of depicting images of all living beings, was considered immutable and absolute by almost all early Islamic religious authorities. Scholars and clerics took as axiomatic that the creation and depiction of living forms is God’s prerogative, not to be trespassed upon by artists and painters. So, although Muslims can rightfully boast of magnificent Islamic architecture such as Taj Mahal and Dome of the Rock, Islamic art was narrowly restricted to decorative figural designs. Aniconism was taken so seriously that — although he later relented — a thoroughly liberal and scientific-minded man like Sir Syed Ahmad Khan refused to be photographed. The Afghan Taliban founder, Mullah Omar, never relented and so no known photo of him exists. The 2005 earthquake in Pakistan’s northern areas was widely attributed to watching television and, two days later, local clerics organised a mass smashing of TV sets in the town of Kaghan. The march of technology, however, made clerics realise they were missing a huge opportunity. Thus began the age of religious TV channels. Although limited initially to audio recitations and images of floating clouds and heavens, talking heads followed. Thereafter televised sermons and religious gatherings became popular and today’s clerical screen personalities have millions of devotees. Asked about earlier restrictions, one such megastar replied in a complicated way that Islam prohibits drawings and photos but not videos. Such adaptive changes are not unique to Islam or Pakistan. Fundamental transformations of thought and action have happened everywhere. Take slavery. From the 15th century onwards, European colonialists stole manpower for developing Europe by depopulating Africa. But slavery began phasing out after the European Enlightenment. The British Empire formally outlawed it in 1833. For the United States to follow suit took a civil war and an additional 32 years. Banning slavery from Muslim countries took much longer. Since the Quran discourages but does not forbid slavery, for nearly 13 centuries the possession of slaves was not condemned as sinful or illegal by any religious authority. In 1909, anti-slavery Young Turks, inspired by the Westernised Kemal Ataturk, forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to free his personal slaves. Ataturk dismissed the last Ottoman caliph in 1924 and so ended slavery. Turkey formally ratified the 1926 League of Nations convention abolishing slavery in 1933. Though Western driven, it was surely a good thing. Whether good or bad, the changes in the UAE’s laws are also Western driven. How the country’s authorities will explain them to the world and their people remains to be seen. Quite possibly no explanation will be forthcoming since UAE is a sovereign country where ruling dynasties exercise total control. Its people don’t have a voice. On the other hand, UAE could try to get endorsements for the new dispensation from pliant muftis and shaikh-ul-Islam. This won’t be the first time. Muslim rulers are thoroughly familiar with using friendly clerics for blessing bank interest disguised to avoid its condemnation as riba. UAE has supported various militant Salafist groups overseas and is said to have considerable control over the authorities of Egypt’s Jamia al-Azhar. This wide outreach could be useful for suppressing possible criticism. UAE’s rulers could also try a more straightforward explanation. The West thrives and prospers in spite of its evolving values — what was immoral yesterday is now simply the new normal. Until the 1960s, cohabitation was fiercely frowned upon in much of Europe and the US. But religious opposition has since softened and, in fact, most religions are following the trend. UAE’s rulers might try arguing that Islam, suitably interpreted, can do so as well. As with child marriage, widow remarriage and polygamy, cohabitation will doubtless lead to furious disputes. But, like it or not, the arrow of time is unidirectional and irreversible. Pakistan could learn much from recent cultural developments and liberalisation of social values in the rest of the Muslim world — a world which it had once aspired to lead. But now in a state of confusion, and dragged willy-nilly by global forces towards an uncertain future, it prefers to keep its eyes fixed firmly upon the past while praying for old times to return.",neutral

"The rebound in economic activity is a feature of recovery from sharp output contractions, and is on display around the world. For Pakistan’s economy to grow sustainably in both the short as well as long run, it has to overcome some serious constraints to growth.  In the medium term, external debt repayments remain elevated and are likely to necessitate a return to the currently suspended IMF programme, as well as a successor Fund programme. With an ‘uncorrected’ programme design that is unsupportive of a quick transition to growth after a period of stabilisation, the IMF programmes will keep the growth trajectory depressed in the medium run.  In the longer term, some features of Pakistan’s secular growth performance over the past four decades underscore the challenges.  The government appears to be misreading the economic situation.  — The economy’s long run growth rate (as measured by a 10-year moving average) has exactly halved between 1970 and 2020, from 7.2 per cent to 3.6pc;  — Since 1980, Pakistan has recorded the lowest per capita income growth among South Asia. In nominal US dollar terms, Sri Lanka’s has increased by a multiple of 14, Bangladesh’s by 8.3 times and India’s by 7.7 times. Pakistan’s per capita income has risen 4.2 times in this period.  — Bangladesh’s per capita income in nominal US dollar terms is now 144pc of Pakistan’s (having overtaken India’s as well this year).  While there is little doubt that Pakistan has had to face exogenous factors that have been unique — such as the large spillover effects of the ‘war on terror’, and internal instability promoted by hostile neighbours and ‘frenemies’ — many of its performance shortfalls are endogenous or self-created. These include the mishandling of the energy crisis since the 1990s, a crumbling fiscal framework, and an unchecked slide in productivity.  A common undercurrent in these failures is something that successive governments have paid little attention to since the 1990s: poor economic governance and management. Successive governments have dropped the ball on exports, energy, domestic resource mobilisation, productivity, promoting export-enhancing FDI, as well as managing myriad policy trade-offs. At the same time, regional competitors such as India and Bangladesh (and other dynamic economies such as China and Vietnam) took full advantage of the first globalisation wave.  A weak institutional framework hangs like a dead albatross around the neck of the state, imposing substantial ‘deadweight’ costs. It produces untenably large inside and outside lags in policy formulation and implementation, leading to a state which is unresponsive both to internal requirements as well as to a rapidly changing external environment.  Added to the structural plus institutional factors is unbridled policy uncertainty and inconsistency. Whether generated by the executive or institutions such as the Supreme Court and NAB, investors have had to face a litany of uncoordinated, ad hoc actions by state organs that have been economic value- and investor-confidence destroying. To make the situation more testing, Pakistan faces emergent and emerging new challenges — from tricky geopolitics to a changing global economic and industrial landscape. These challenges stem from shifting sands in the Gulf, the possibly diminished role of China in the world economy going forward due to reconfiguration of global supply chains, and the advent of the ‘fourth industrial revolution’.  What does Pakistan need to do to meet the growth challenge? In the short to medium term, fixing the tax system such that it supports rather than penalises investment and commercial activities of the formal sector is one of the most critical imperatives. Efforts to ease the energy constraint and address affordability for industry will pay dividends. This is an area where the present government’s efforts are commendable and far ahead of the unidimensional response of previous administrations which focused only on adding power generation capacity. Pakistan also needs to better leverage CPEC as a potent growth driver, especially with regard to using it as an economic diplomacy platform viz Turkey, Qatar, Iran, Russia and the Central Asian states.  Another growth driver initially, especially when Pakistan is facing challenges with its external account, is agriculture. Extracting growth from agriculture has multiple advantages, not least that it generates growth without import-dependency. It can provide exportable surpluses as well as opportunities for import-substitution, besides giving a boost to farmer and rural household incomes.  In the medium term, reducing the footprint of the public sector will free up space for private firms and competition as well as innovation, while better management of cities such as Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Peshawar and the ‘golden triangle’ (as well as urbanisation more generally) can be a robust potential growth driver.  Central to the policy response has to be improved economic governance and management. This can only be ensured via meaningful institutional reforms, especially with regard to reconfiguring as well as reinvigorating the civil service, FBR and the Planning Commission (including the provincial planning and development departments). A portfolio of projects will provide a short-term impulse but is unlikely to improve Pakistan’s growth trajectory on its own. Better governance is the key to unlocking growth.  In short, a full-spectrum ‘back to basics’ approach that focuses on largely absent building blocks of growth (literacy, productivity, innovation, private investment, a growth-supportive tax system, and institutional quality) is required. While it will be a tall order to lay a more solid foundation, the silver lining is that given the low baseline, any meaningful effort on this front is bound to release a strong and sustained growth impulsea.",neutral

"Were such messages exchanged this time around too? Perhaps they were but it did seem that the happiness was directed inwardly, this time around. It may not be wrong to say that Trump, unlike George Bush, was more a burden domestically than internationally, for the Americans. (One year after he was elected, Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize; it was perhaps the singular piece of evidence of the hope that internationally was pinned on him.) On the other hand, Trump’s election and his defeat, rather than Biden’s victory, underlines the insularity of American politics at the moment.  The US is now more polarised and divided than it was then. As of Monday morning, according to The Washington Post, Biden’s lead in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Georgia over Trump was less than one per cent. This could, however, change in the days to come but so far it simply reflects a divided American society.  But Trump’s electoral defeat does not mean the end of the crisis in American politics. And this crisis will continue whether he remains in politics or not.  That Trump didn’t deliver on his populist politics in four years didn’t deter his supporters.  Trump’s victory four years ago (and Hillary Clinton’s defeat then) was proof of an electorate which is not interested in what traditional political parties and traditional politicians have to offer. Indeed, Trump’s success four years ago showed — for lack of a better phrase — that the traditional political system upheld by the parties was broken. And it is still not fixed.  As a historian quoted in The New Yorker says, “The component of both parties that did not grapple with the insecurity of most Americans — that created the opportunity for exclusionary politics. It’s not Trump. It’s an opportunity that Trump seized.”  He tapped into the people’s discontent over economic issues; he appeared more populist and anti-elite than Clinton in 2016, and for his own supporters he more or less was able to sustain this image four years later too. (So far it seems that Biden’s victory was driven by greater mobilisation of the Democratic vote than in 2016.) That Trump didn’t deliver on his populist politics in four years didn’t deter his supporters is the biggest takeaway from this election.  This economic insecurity will not vanish with Biden’s election — and the Republicans will be tempted to tap into it. Trump or his son or someone else from the party could make a similar pitch, at the time of another election. This may prove to be the biggest challenge for the new president.  Hence, the shadows of Trump will continue to haunt Biden; after all, Obama was constantly hindered by the Republican Party during his presidency. One can only imagine the mood of the party after Trump; anyone showing any hint of cooperation will face pressure or criticism from within the party and few will be willing to withstand it especially as this is also the mood within the electorate/the party’s support base.  Along with this polarisation in society, the divisions within the Democratic Party will not make it an easy ride for Biden either. Analysts are already predicting the problems he will face, especially when faced with a legislature in the hands of the Republicans — so far, it seems that the Republicans have a good chance of retaining the Senate and reducing the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives — and a conservative Supreme Court. In addition, the Democratic Party is also not a unified force, and some feel that there will be pressure from within his own party — Bernie Sanders et al — to put in place more progressive policies. Even during such a crucial election, the more conservative members of the party were criticising others of having cost them votes because of their ‘socialism’. The ‘left wing’ of the party is no less angry — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s recent interview to The New York Times says it all where she accuses her party of hostility. “It’s your own party thinking you’re the enemy. When your own colleagues talk anonymously in the press and then turn around and say you’re bad...,” she is quoted as having said.  Of course, this is not to say that all the predictions are gloomy. It is always possible that Joe Biden is the centrist who manages to paper over the divisions between his own party and the society he is now leading. He is, after all, a white man who has won the election and is known for his qualities of empathy — his election campaign made much of his own personal tragedies and his ability to connect with people due to his own suffering.  But few are willing to bet on the more hopeful end of the analysis spectrum; after all, it’s hard to forget that eight years of Obama ended in a Trump victory.  But closer to home, it is hard to believe that the relationship with Pakistan will change much due to the new incumbent in the White House. It may not do to pin too much hope on Biden because of his role in the Kerry-Lugar aid bill. Those were different times, and the US back then believed that the war in Afghanistan could somehow still be won. Now the priorities are different — in Afghanistan, as well as the understanding of what is possible in Pakistan. Chances are that the efforts to talk peace in Afghanistan will continue, as will the pressure on Pakistan to deliver. Neither will there be any change to the rivalry with China, which too has its impact on US-Pakistan relations. The biggest change in the region may be the Iran nuclear deal and what it may bring for us.",neutral
"Our prime ministers get confused about geography and missile technology. And some of them defend not just U-turns but the ‘U-turn’ as a principle. Our civil society complains about judicial overreach and yet it petitions the judges to look into political matters, when offended by twists and turns of the madness called politics in Pakistan.  Clarity is overrated and contradictions are acceptable. No wonder then that all our politicians are busy proving who is the bigger patriot and defender of the armed forces, as they declaim their democratic credentials. The bigger the patriot, the bigger the democrat and well-wisher of the armed forces. And this is also why, democrats want civilian supremacy and rule of law but then blame only an individual or two. So what if history proves otherwise?  Our democrats also put their own spin on their democratic beliefs. A true democrat is fine with a government being sent packing before its tenure is over because of incompetence while another kind of democrat is angry that ‘corrupt’ rivals (and some friends) cannot be put behind bars immediately because due process is such an inconvenience. Corruption too is unacceptable when mafias are involved and just a part of life when chief executives from little-known places are pressured by their country cousins for small-time government postings or jobs. If the two positions are contradictory, no one loses any sleep, it seems.  The obsession to televise every speech and every dialogue may negate the idea of a meaningful exchange.  In this body politic, then, language is rarely ever precise or clear. At times the ambiguity is deliberate, a precaution — when we refer to ‘khalai makhlooq’ or explain away a missing couple of days in one’s life as a short holiday to the northern areas. At other times, the lack of clarity is because we are just lazy and can’t be bothered to focus our thoughts.  So, it is these days, as we try and figure out how the political class and the establishment (another precautionary euphemism) can lower the raised political temperatures; we casually refer to vastly different processes in the same breath. A truth and reconciliation commission and a national dialogue are both easy solutions for the larai jhagra (bickering) at present.  But which one is the answer? Surely, a truth and reconciliation committee is about resolving some matters of the past while a national dialogue seems to look to the future.  Truth and reconciliation commissions are formed when retribution is not possible; when the aim is to simply allow people to speak of what they have suffered as well as what they have inflicted on others and hope that it will heal some of the rifts and wounds and bring a people together. Rarely is there punishment involved and sometimes not even coercion to ensure the truth. Such concepts seem so far away in the midst of an angry season, which is unchanging. None of our politicians seem to be in the mood for this; for they are all busy trumpeting like Maula Jatt and not aspiring to be Nelson Mandela. And there was so much more to him than just his long imprisonment.  Moments in history can be made and unmade by men. And we are too busy unmaking it to be invested in any truths and any reconciliations.  A national dialogue is another suggestion but once again no one has any details to offer. Details are boring and unworthy of talk shows, which set all agendas these days. And a national dialogue makes for a good sound bite that can withstand an hour-long back-and-forth and no more. Some say it should be about improving election and accountability laws; as if our only problem is the making of legislation (by hook or by crook) and not its implementation.  Others say it should be about running the country according to the Constitution — as if this is a simple matter resolved by a bit of talk-shalk, in parliament or outside it (as if the National Security Council or the previous exchange in the National Assembly led to any progress on this matter). The politicos and the non-civilians will sit down at one table to talk; the politicos will say the Constitution mandates us to rule and the other side will say, ‘Oh yes, you do! And now that this has been pointed out, we will let you be’. Surely, if it was this simple, we wouldn’t be grappling with this problem after so many years.  And this is also to be televised, so the people are watching. This obsession to televise every speech, every dialogue and every revolution may run contrary to the idea of a meaningful exchange but no one seems to care.  We are averse to details and planning; always have been. For we rarely talk and create consensus within, making it well-nigh impossible to learn how to find common ground with the other. So none of the political players agree with each other on what they are up to. The revolutionary hasn’t taken his team members on board on what the end game is and neither are all the naya premier’s players onboard with his various crusades including the one against the purana Pakistanis. Everyone is busy writing on his own page and ignoring what the others are scribbling away.  We need more detail, boring detail, and much gup-shup in private if we are serious about dialogue — and to simply figure out what the dialogue will be about.

"Despite a slight price decrease in the international oil markets, the government on Wednesday decided to maintain the rates of petroleum products barring high speed diesel (HSD) for the first fortnight of October.  The HSD price has been decreased by Rs2.40 to Rs104.06 per litre for next 15 days, the Ministry of Finance announced on late Wedn\xadesday evening.  However, the Prime Minister’s Office earlier in the afternoon said that Prime Minister Imran Khan had decided that there would be on increase in the prices of petrol during next 15 days.  Used by the large traffic vehicles, generators and many machines, HSD has the largest consumption share as a fuel in the country.  HSD consumption is comparatively low in the month of October as there is no significant demand either from the agriculture sector or for running generators.  At the same time, the government has decided not to change the prices of other petroleum fuels for the second consecutive month.  Per litre price of petrol will continue to be Rs103.97, followed by kerosene oil Rs65.29 and light diesel oil (LDO) Rs62.86. LDO is used in certain kinds of vehicle engines and mills mainly used in rural areas to operate tube wells and flour grinding etc.  Meanwhile, sources in the Petroleum Division said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had determined reduction in the prices of petroleum fuel for the first 15 days of October.  Sources added that the oil prices had witnessed a decline in international markets in the month of September. Crude oil witnessed a drop of 0.36 per cent in the Opec basket to close the month at $41.46 per barrel. At the same time the rates of Arab light crude oil declined by 4.53pc at the end of September to $40.06 a barrel compared to $46.45 at the start of the month.  The official added that the differential by not passing on the reduction at the international markets will balance the cuts made in taxes and levies by the government for the month of September when the oil prices were kept stable by the prime minister in the wake of massive loss suffered residents of many areas due to floods.  Ogra on Wednesday has increased the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs3 per kilogramme to Rs113 for the month of October. The Ogra notification said that the price of an 11.8kg domestic cylinder has been increased by Rs34 while the rate of commercial cylinder has been hiked by Rs130.  Ghee, toothpaste prices up  Meanwhile, Utility Stores announced a revision in prices — largely upwards — for items in edible and non-edible categories.  The per kg price of ghee saw a hike of from Rs4 to Rs33 for different brands. Similarly, cooking oil prices were raised by Rs2 to Rs20. Prices of toothbrushes have been increased in the range of Rs14-35 a piece while toothpaste rates jumped Rs5-20. Cashewnuts prices saw an increase of Rs24-47 per 200 grams, red chili powder has been increased by Rs73 per 400 grams.  Prices of shaving creams have been increased by Rs20. Mosquito repellents, chocolates, jams, vinegars, cleaners, soaps etc, also saw an increase.",neutral
"Palestinian mother-of-five Nayla Abu Jubbah launched a small revolution this week by becoming the first female taxi driver in the deeply conservative Gaza Strip.  In the impoverished Palestinian territory, women have the same legal rights as men to drive a vehicle, but in practice the trade of taxi driver has been exclusively male — until now.  “One day I was talking with a friend who works as a hairdresser and I said to her: ‘What would you say if we started a taxi service for women?’ She said it was a crazy idea,” the 39-year-old said.  The Israeli-blockaded territory was suffering 50 percent unemployment even before the Covid-19 pandemic.  After drinking a steaming cup of tea in her home, the social work graduate in a headscarf puts on a face mask and marches to her car parked outside.  After slotting her smartphone into its holder and giving a toot on the horn for show, she starts the engine and is off on the roads of Gaza, where the Islamist Hamas movement has ruled for more than 13 years.  Abu Jubbah does not cruise the streets for fares, taking only advance bookings.  “I leave my home and I will pick up my clients, to bring them for example from the hairdressing salon to a wedding,” she says.  She bought the vehicle with her inheritance when her father died.  “I said to myself one day that I needed to take advantage of the car, to put it to work,” she said. “Hence the project of a taxi service entirely for women, to put them at ease.” Today she is driving through the streets of Gaza City to pick up 27-year-old Aya Saleem for a shopping trip.  “We live in a conservative society. So when I saw that there was a taxi company especially for women... I felt a kind of freedom”, says Saleem.

"Sony's PlayStation 5 hit the shelves on Thursday, just two days after rival Microsoft released its newest Xbox, with the next-generation consoles vying for holiday season dominance as the pandemic boosts gaming demand.  With pre-orders pointing to a record launch, market leader Sony is counting on big-ticket exclusive games like ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" to keep the edge over its US challenger.  But with coronavirus cases rising in many countries, launch events are off the table, and crowds of eager customers out of the question.  While the new Xbox hit shelves worldwide on Tuesday, the PS5 is available from Thursday in Australia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, North America and South Korea, but gamers elsewhere will have to wait until November 19.  In Sydney, just a handful of customers were collecting their pre-ordered consoles on Thursday morning.  ""It's Covid, so I guess not many people want to rush to a launch,"" said Theo Pasialis as he collected his PlayStation.  Jonathan De Botton, one customer, said the atmosphere was a world away from the PS4 launch, when lines of customers stretched into a shopping mall food court.  Today was ""completely different,"" he told AFP.  ""It was a midnight launch... It was a good time,"" he added.  Today, by comparison, it was ""a bit of a ghost town"".  The consoles go on sale with the pandemic creating a massive spike in demand for gaming from people stuck at home and looking for a distraction or a way to pass the time.  Just how long that boom will last remains unclear, with news this week of progress on a virus vaccine prompting a gaming sector sell-off on stock markets, as investors anticipated a return to normal life.  Lion's share For Sony, the stakes with its new console are significantly higher than for Microsoft, as gaming generates the lion\'s share of the Japanese firm\'s profits and about a third of its sales.  Gaming accounts for just 10 percent of Microsoft\'s sales, by comparison.  But Sony\'s margin on the PS5 will be slim, possibly even loss-making, analysts say — with the company counting on sales of games, services and online subscriptions to turn a profit.  Sony expects to sell 7.6 million PS5 consoles by the end of March -- beating the performance of the PS4.  And it will be relying heavily on the US market to achieve that, with Japan\'s video game market more focused on mobile and still dominated by Nintendo, said Serkan Toto, an analyst at Kantan Games.  ""You\'re talking about a relatively small market in Japan... driving Sony to centralise the PlayStation business in one area, and that area is the United States,"" he told AFP.  Toto said he expected the PS5 to outperform the PS4.  ""I think that the PlayStation 4 was so successful that Sony has cultivated a much bigger fan base for PlayStation content,"" he said.  The PS5 is priced at $500, like the Xbox Series X, while a version without a disk reader costs $400.  That is more than the $300 price tag for Microsoft\'s less powerful Xbox Series S, which also has no disk reader.  The cheaper consoles with no disk reader are aimed at gamers with fast connections and willing to play online, and this is a group that is expanding, according to the head of Sony\'s video gaming unit, Jim Ryan.  ""Last year, it was about 50-50 and, one of the things that we\'ve seen with the lockdowns is that digital ratio has jumped over the course in 2020,"" he told AFP.  ""It\'s been two-thirds for digital and one-third for physical,"" said Ryan, adding that Sony has no plans to drop machines with disk readers.",neutral

The claim is false; scientists say hantavirus is not a new virus and was first detected during the Korean War in the 1950s; the US-based Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says the virus has almost exclusively been found to pass from rodents to humans, rather than from person to person.  The misleading claim was shared this Facebook post on March 24, 2020.

""There is a new virus in China named Hantavirus which is caused due to rats  ""One died and few tested positive.""  COVID-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It has killed more than 36,000 people and infected almost 754,000 others worldwide, according to data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).  Below is a screenshot of the misleading post:   One case of hantavirus was reported in the province of Shandong here in a tweet by Chinese state media organisation Global Times on March 24, 2020.  A similar claim that hantavirus is a ""new virus"" was shared by Australia-based Facebook users here and here. The claim was also included in videos on Twitter here, here, here and here, which were viewed thousands of times. A similar claim was also viewed hundreds of thousands of times in videos shared by Indian media WION here and ET Now here.  The claim is false; scientists have said hantavirus is not new and was first detected during the Korean War in the 1950s.  This 2010 study titled “A Global Perspective on Hantavirus Ecology, Epidemiology, and Disease” was published in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews. It states: ”In the past century, two major outbreaks of disease led to the discovery of hantaviruses in the Old and New Worlds. The first outbreak occurred during the Korean War (1950 to 1953), wherein more than 3,000 United Nations troops fell ill with Korean hemorrhagic fever, which is commonly referred to as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).”  This video produced by the University of California, San Francisco, gives more details about hantavirus.   Hantavirus is almost exclusively transmitted from rodents to humans, rather than from person to person, according to the US-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  “Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a severe, sometimes fatal, respiratory disease in humans caused by infection with hantaviruses. Anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry hantaviruses is at risk of HPS. The hantaviruses that cause human illness in the United States cannot be transmitted from one person to another. In Chile and Argentina, rare cases of person-to-person transmission have occurred among close contacts of a person who was ill with a type of hantavirus called Andes virus,” the CDC says.  There is currently no specific treatment, cure or vaccine for HPS or COVID-19.   COVID-19 is a respiratory illness which passes from person to person. The mortality rate of for the disease is about one to two percent as of March 2020.  For HPS, the mortality rate is 38 percent, according to the CDC.

The same infographic purporting to show that COVID-19 fits a centenary pattern of global virus outbreaks was also shared on Facebook here and on Twitter here. A similar timeline and claim was shared on YouTube here.  The claim is false; the outbreaks listed in the infographic are inaccurately dated and falsely characterised.  Historic health crises The “Black Death,” for instance, first broke out between 1347 to 1351, some 400 years before the date indicated in the infographic, according to this report by the US National Human Genome Research Institute. That plague was also caused by bacteria, not a virus, the World Health Organization notes here.  Cholera pandemics, which have occurred six times between 1817 and 1923, were also caused by bacteria rather than a virus, according to this report in The Lancet, a peer-reviewed medical journal. A seventh and continuing cholera pandemic began in 1961.  This US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention page states that the “Spanish flu” pandemic occurred in 1918, two years earlier than the date in the infographic.  This AFP explainer lists seven other major epidemics that occurred in the past century —  including Ebola, SARS and AIDS — which do not fit the supposed pattern described in the infographic.  \'No pattern\' Health experts also refuted the claim made alongside the infographic.  “No, there’s no pattern there,” Dr. Susan Mercado, special envoy to the Philippine President for global health initiatives, told AFP by phone on March 13, 2020. “But if you’re asking if some viruses are indeed seasonal, they are.”  A WHO spokesperson also told AFP in an email on March 12, 2020 that while “epidemics for certain diseases are cyclical,” the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic “is unpredictable, and that’s because the disease is new.”",neutral
"A photo of Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has been shared thousands of times in multiple Facebook posts which claim it shows him wearing a yellow Sikh turban at a religious ceremony.

The caption’s mention of the Kashmiri flag refers to an incident on August 30 in which Khan allegedly declined to hold the flag during a protest in Islamabad, Pakistan’s capital. The rally was held to protest India’s recent move to exert greater control over part of the region. Khan can purportedly be seen here declining to hold the flag in a video published by Indian news channel NewsX.  An AFP report here provides greater detail about the issue.  The same photo was also published on Facebook here, here and here, with a similar claim; and on Twitter here.

"Social media users in Canada claim that the October 21 federal elections were spoiled by voter fraud, because 35 million votes were counted when Canada only has 27.5 million eligible voters. This is false: 18.5 million ballots were cast during the 2019 vote, Elections Canada, the country’s electoral agency told AFP, while 35 million refers to the number of ballots printed to avoid shortages.  “Shocking, 35 millions votes were counted but we only have 27.4 millions registered voters,” a Facebook post published a few weeks after the Canadian federal election reads. Below the text is a screenshot of the French version of Elections Canada’s website, which provides numbers on the resources deployed for Canada’s 43rd federal election. Circled in red are two numbers, 35 million and 27.4 million, next to the words “bulletins de vote imprimés” and “électeurs.”   In the comments section, outraged Facebook users complain that “the system is rigged,” and that the issue “has to be investigated.”  The Facebook post was itself a screenshot of a now deleted tweet from Sarah Chung, a former Olympian turned candidate for the right-wing People’s Party of Canada in the Ontario riding of Markham-Unionville. Though Chung’s name is not included in the screenshot, her Twitter handle, @SChungforCanada, is clearly visible in the screenshots.  Chung deleted her tweet after a Twitter user pointed out that “bulletins de vote imprimés,” means “printed ballots,” not counted ballots, as the screenshot of the English version of the website below shows.   Despite the original misunderstanding, Chung tweeted again on the matter of additional ballots, this time using the English version of the Elections Canada website, and suggesting that non-citizens could have voted, or that some people could have voted several times.  According to Elections Canada’s preliminary numbers, 18,530,285 votes were cast in the 2019 general elections, 179,536 of which were rejected.   Ghislain Desjardins, a spokesperson for Elections Canada, told AFP in an email, “It is essential for Elections Canada to print significantly more ballots than there are electors that will actually vote, in order to make sure that no polling location runs out.”  Desjardins explained that ballots are sent to polling stations in books of 50, and therefore a polling station requiring 202 ballots would automatically receive 250, which, at the scale of the entire country, contributes to the higher ballot count.  More ballots are also needed due to advance voting. Any unused ballots from advance polls cannot be reused on election day, according to Desjardins.  Ballots that are not used on election day “are securely destroyed by Elections Canada,” Desjardins added.  The source of the hoax seems to be Twitter user Patrick Potvin, who was the first to tweet the screenshot of Election Canada’s website, calling it a “#riggedelection with 7.8 millions illegal voters.”   The electoral system in Canada is not foolproof. In May 2019, 103,000 non-citizens had to be removed from the voters registry after being added by mistake. Citizenship is required in order to vote in Canada and voting as a non-citizen is an offence punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and/or six months in prison.  After the 2015 federal election, four people were charged with requesting second ballots after already voting. Here is a list of all of the charges and outcomes of cases brought under the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act since 2011.",neutral
"A Thai-language Facebook post claims that eating a sugar-free diet will cause cancer cells to ""die naturally"". The misleading post, which also claims that hot lemon water and coconut oil cure cancer, has been shared tens of thousands of times. Similar misleading claims have circulated in social media posts from Africa to the United States. But the claims are all false; numerous doctors, cancer charities, and scientific studies all say that eating a sugar-free diet, drinking hot lemon water, and taking spoonfuls of coconut oil are not cures for cancer.  The post was published here on a Thailand-based Facebook page on July 8, 2019, where it has been shared more than 39,000 times.  The lengthy Thai-language caption translates to English in part as: “#howdocancerpatientsdie? Russian research found out that the cause of cancer patients’ death is from carelessness.""  The post claims: ""If patients stop eating sugar, cancer cells will die naturally.""  It also claims: ""Mixing lemon with hot water and drinking it for three months is actually better than chemotherapy.  It adds a final claim: ""Take spoonfuls of organic coconut oil morning and night, and cancer cells will gradually disappear.”  Below is a screenshot of the misleading Thai-language post:   Similar claims about cancer cures have also been shared in Thai-language posts here, here, here, here, here, and here.  Similar claims about a no-sugar diet\'s cancer-killing abilities, and the benefits of hot water and lemon and coconut oil, have been in English on Facebook pages from America to Kenya.   No-sugar? Multiple doctors told AFP that the claim that a sugar-free diet causes ""cancer cells (to) die naturally"" is false; scientific studies also show that normal, healthy cells need sugar for energy.  Dr. Punlert Tanyakul, an oncologist at Phyathai Hospital in Bangkok, told AFP by phone on November 11, 2019, warned against a no-sugar diet.  “It is certainly not good to cut sugar out of your diet as sugar is needed for every human being’s body. If you don’t have any sugar in your body, body cells will not be able to survive and will be unable to function.""  But he added that ""consuming too much sugar could increase the risks of cancer.”  Glucose is a primary energy source for most cells, according to this report published by the US-based National Library of Medicine.  The report states in part: “Glucose is a primary energy source for most cells and an important substrate for many biochemical reactions. As glucose is a need of each and every cell of the body, so are the glucose transporters”.  This report, \'Curing cancer with effective methods for the better lives of patients\', written by Dr. Isara Anongchanya for the Vejthani Hospital in Bangkok does not list a sugar-free diet as a cure for cancer.  The ""effective methods"" for treating cancer listed in the report include: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and bone marrow/stem cell transplantation.  This article published by UK based cancer charity Cancer Research UK states there is no evidence that a sugar-free diet can lower the risk of getting cancer or increase the chances of surviving it after diagnosis.  Cancer Research also published a video on YouTube here headlined: ""Does Sugar Feed Cancer"".  ""Fact: cutting out processed sugar won\'t kill cancer cells"" the video report says.   The Cancer Research written report states in part: “Cancer cells usually grow quickly, multiplying at a fast rate, which takes a lot of energy. This means they need lots of glucose. Cancer cells also need lots of other nutrients too, such as amino acids and fats; it’s not just sugar they crave.  “Here’s where the myth that sugar fuels cancer was born: if cancer cells need lots of glucose, then cutting sugar out of our diet must help stop cancer growth, and could even stop it developing in the first place. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. All our healthy cells need glucose too, and there’s no way of telling our bodies to let healthy cells have the glucose they need, but not give it to cancer cells.  “There’s no evidence that following a \'sugar-free\' diet lowers the risk of getting cancer, or boosts the chances of surviving if you are diagnosed.”   Lemon water  AFP has previously fact-checked claims that drinking hot lemon water can cure cancer in this report published in French on June 18, 2019.  Professor Nicolas Boissel, a specialist in blood cancer at the Saint-Louis hospital in Paris, told AFP: ""Neither hot water, nor lemon, nor sugar-free diets have proven anti-cancer action. Lemon derivatives (like many other plants for that matter) have shown anti-cancer activity. This probably explains the confusion.”  Coconut oil  The misleading post also claims: ""Take spoonfuls of organic coconut oil morning and night, and cancer cells will gradually disappear.”  Multiple other Thai-language posts on Facebook make similar claims about the purported role of coconut oil as a cure for cancer, for example here, here, and here.  Below is a screenshot of one of the misleading Facebook posts:   The misleading post\'s caption says: “Coconut oil’s effectiveness in killing colon cancer cells is as high as 93%” and it shares a link to a post with the same headline on a real estate blog.  The claim is false.  There is some evidence that lauric acid, which is found in coconut oil, could inhibit cancer cells’ growth, according to this study published by the US-based National Library of Medicine in 2017.  But the study cautioned that: ""additional studies are warranted to further corroborate (lauric acid\'s) usefulness in more comprehensive therapeutic approaches.”  Oncologist Dr Punlert told AFP that the claim that taking ""spoonfuls of organic coconut oil"" would cause cancer to disappear was incorrect.  “The claim is false. We haven’t seen any evidence or information about the cancer treatment related to coconut oil in the human body.”  This claim has previously been fact-checked by Africa Check in a June 2019 report published here.",neutral
"As Canada enters flu season, many online posts warn individuals that getting vaccinated will cause them to be contagious for several weeks. This is false; flu shots contain dead influenza viruses that are not infectious, according to the Canadian Public Health Agency (CPHA) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC).  A screengrab of plain text explaining that flu shots turn people into “an active live walking virus” was shared at least one thousand times in the past week. One Facebook user added the caption: “Your the carrier. Wake up!” as a warning.   This myth is widespread enough that several health institutions explicitly debunk it on their websites, including the CPHA, the Harvard Medical School, the CDC, and the University of California, Los Angeles health center.  “I haven’t heard of this before, but it makes no scientific sense whatsoever,” according to Dr. Ian Gemmill, former chair of Immunize Canada, a coalition of non-government health organizations.  All influenza vaccines approved in Canada this season are inactivated. “Yes the virus was live at one time but it is inactivated, which means it’s dead. It does not replicate, it has no ability to infect anybody,” Gemmill told AFP.  Some vaccines, he added, have not only been inactivated but have also been split, and sometimes even purified down to the protein needed to create the vaccine.  Once administered, the vaccine and the virus it contains stimulate immune cells that will be ready should the vaccine receiver come in contact with live flu virus.  Gemmill compared a vaccinated body to an army that is prepared and knows what the enemy looks like, allowing it to fight the virus before it can take hold. An unvaccinated person’s immune system would not react so quickly and would have to fight the enemy faction, which is the illness.  The list of flu shots authorized in Canada in 2019-2020 is publicly available on Health Canada’s website. Nine flu shots are authorized in Canada for the current influenza season.   FluMist Quadrivalent is a flu vaccine that is only weakened (attenuated), rather than inactivated. Although it is licensed in Canada this year, it is not commercially available, Gemmill told AFP.  Although theoretically possible, chances are slim that a live attenuated virus would be transmitted from the patient to another individual because the dose used in a single shot is so small and the virus so weak, Gemmill said. He added that he has never seen a report of contamination caused by vaccination.  Vaccines in Canada must go through a rigorous multi-step evaluation before they can be commercialized or administered in the country, according to Health Canada.  Flu viruses are constantly changing, so, flu shots change annually; the variations in their composition are determined by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendations for that year, although the composition may be maintained over multiple years. Flu vaccine composition for the entire northern hemisphere is decided by the WHO every January, and manufacturers propose new vaccines in the following months.  The flu vaccine is a regular source of misinformation. AFP Fact Check has also written about misleading posts about the ingredients in flu vaccines.",neutral
"As Canada enters flu season, many online posts warn individuals that getting vaccinated will cause them to be contagious for several weeks. This is President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria told the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York last month that the Lake Chad basin has shrunk significantly due to climate change, depriving many people of their livelihood in the region.   Numerous Twitter users challenged the president’s statement by claiming research showed the lake was not shrinking. AFP checked the latest international report on the issue and found that while Lake Chad has shrunk significantly in the past, the shrinking has stopped in recent years.  “As you are aware, the Lake Chad Basin, which used to be a region of productivity, food security and wealth for an estimated 40 million citizens living around the lake basin, has shrunk significantly from its original size due to climate change,” President Buhari said in his speech to the UN on September 23.  “We will continue to lead in efforts to have solid partnerships for the ecological restoration and recharge of Lake Chad.”   The statement drew criticism online from some Twitter users who said that the latest research contradicted the president.  “The most resent (sic) study below shows LAKE CHAD IS NOT SHRINKING stop disgracing us sir!” Olushola Olufolabi, a staunch Buhari critic, wrote in a tweet shared 150 times, and archived here.  “Your only knowledge of climate change starts and stops at Lake Chad .. What is really your obsession with that lake and shrinking ?? Even when many reports says it is not in any way shrinking ..Baba shift ur attention to more important aspect of climate change..” wrote another user, Akhogba Era.  Lake Chad did shrink signficantly in the 1970s and 1980s   A Chadian fisherman holds his catch on the shores of Lake Chad, near the village of Tagal. (AFP / Michele Cattani) Lake Chad borders northeast Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, and Chad, serving millions of people from all four countries. The region is a hotbed for the Boko Haram insurgency that has displaced over two million people in the past decade and the area remains a stronghold for militants.  We went through a recent authoritative report funded by the German and Dutch governments and found that while the lake is considerably smaller than it was 50 years ago, it has stopped shrinking in recent years.  “Whilst the lake contracted significantly due to drought in the 1970s and 1980s, our research finds that the lake is currently not shrinking,” says the report, which was published in May by German think-tank Adelphi.  “These droughts led to the lake shrinking from a high point of 25,000 km² in the 1960s, when it was the world’s sixth largest freshwater body and a thriving commercial hub for the entire Sahel, to just 2,000 km² in the 1990s.”  The report went on to state that “by displacing communities and undermining state legitimacy, the droughts helped set in motion a train of events which is still being felt today. Whereas the lake’s shrinking has indeed fed into the current crisis, the lake has since expanded to roughly 14,000 km².”  As for the current size of the lake, this “has proven relatively stable over the past two decades. Indeed, the total water storage has actually increased, if one includes groundwater as well as surface water, which runs counter to the prevailing narrative of a lake in terminal decline.”  According to the authors — Janani Vivekananda, Dr Martin Wall, Dr Florence Sylvestre, Chitra Nagarajan — the report “is the first of its kind on the Lake Chad region and a pioneer among climate-fragility risk assessments globally”.  It is said to be the product of an intensive two-year period of research across all four countries, “drawing on long-term hydrological data from the Lake Chad basin, ground measurements, brand new analysis of 20 years of satellite observations”, and hundreds of interviews with local residents.  What the UN has said before  Last year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told an international conference on Lake Chad that its water level had shrunk by 90 percent compared to the 1960s.  “Lake Chad was once a major source of livelihoods for millions of people living throughout its basin,” Guterres said in a message to the conference in Abuja, delivered by the UN’s West Africa representative Mohammed Ibn Chambas.  “Today, the lake’s water level has shrunk 90 per cent compared with what it was in the 1960s, and its surface area has decreased from 22,000 square kilometres to a mere 1,350 square kilometres.”  If that figure given by Guterres last year for the estimated size of the lake sounds vastly different from the recent report, that’s because it is — 1,350 square kilometres versus 14,000.  But we found that Guterres was quoting a figure given in a 2002 UN report, which was in turn citing research published in 2001. The latest data available does suggest the lake has expanded significantly since then.  Lake Chad is still threatened by climate change  Buhari did not cite a timeframe in his speech to the UN and it is correct to say that the lake has shrunk significantly since its peak in the 1960s. But as the recent report argues, it is wrong to say that the lake is still shrinking.  Irrespective of the size of Lake Chad, however, climate change is still having a profound negative effect on the region and calls for increased international attention are justified.  “Climate change is having profound adverse impacts on the conflict, intensifying existing dynamics and creating new risks. But an alleged shrinking of the lake is not the problem,” the report said.  “High levels of rainfall and wide temperature variability are undermining people’s lives and livelihoods. Temperatures in the region are rising one and a half times faster than the global average. And climate projections predict that weather conditions will only become more extreme and more unpredictable.”",neutral
"Rallies across the country will be held as the PDM planned until the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government is removed, representatives of the opposition parties declared while speaking at a joint press conference at Peshawar Press Club. Pakistan Peoples Party’s central information secretary Dr Nafeesa Shah at a separate presser also warned the government against playing with the emotions of the masses, asking the administration to allow the 11-party opposition alliance to hold its Peshawar rally in a ‘peaceful’ manner. Friday saw a flurry of statements and press conference soon after the Peshawar deputy commissioner refused to allow the opposition, which had earlier held public meetings in cities of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, to hold their rally scheduled for Nov 22 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s capital. In a rejoinder to PDM’s request for permission, the Peshawar DC said: “The Covid-19 positivity rate [in] District Peshawar has presently exceeded 13%, which is alarmingly high and any large public gathering is likely to further increase the spread of life-threatening virus. The undersigned regrets to inform you that permission for the said event has not been granted.” Just two days ago, Railways Minister Shaikh Rashid Ahmed while holding a press conference in Islamabad had advised the opposition leaders to enter into a dialogue with the government to steer the country out of the political impasse. Accompanied by PPP Senator Rubina Khalid, Ms Shah told the presser in Peshawar that PDM’s rallies had baffled the PTI government that had offered to resolve issues through dialogue. Expressing serious concern over the increasing prices of life-saving drugs, food items and other essential commodities, the PPP central information secretary said the existing inflation was the outcome of bad governance. She said the government was trying to hide behind the pandemic but warned that it would not find any route to escape. About the spread of virus, Ms Shah said political parties had advised all their workers to take necessary measures to ensure their safety. The PPP leader alleged that Gilgit-Baltistan election once again proved that the PTI had come to power through election engineering. To disrupt the anti-government movement being run by the people of Pakistan, the rulers were trying to use ‘Covid engineering’, she said in reference to the restriction on their public gathering. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s KP chapter chief Senator Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman, Awami National Party’s KP general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak, PPP’s KP president Humayun Khan, Qaumi Watan Party’s provincial chapter chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao, KP information secretary of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Ikhtyar Wali Khan, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party representative Mukhtiar Yousufzai, Jamiat Ahle Hadith representative Dr Zakir also spoke during the press conference. They condemned the administration for turning down the permission for the Sunday gathering and said the rulers were using different pretexts to disturb the people’s movement against the government. They warned the government that any attempt to create hurdles in the holding of PDM’s meetings would spark street protests. The JUI-F’s KP chief said the removal of banners and posters and denying permission for holding the public rally were the tactics being used by the government to pressure the PDM to cancel its events. “We are ready to go to extreme point against government,” the JUI-F leader declared, demanding the establishment to stop supporting the PTI government. ANP’s Babak said it was fundamental right of the people to hold peaceful meetings. Leaders of the ruling PTI, which did not take any precautionary measure at all while recently holding public meetings in Gilgit-Baltistan last week, were asking the PDM not to hold meetings due to the pandemic. QWP’s Sherpao and PML-N’s Khan described the PTI government more dangerous than Covid-19, saying that it was time to get rid of ‘Covid-18’. Earlier addressing a press conference in Islamabad, federal Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid had suggested the opposition parties to hold talks with PM Khan to end political impasse. “If you don’t hold dialogue with the prime minister, the narrative of [PML-N supremo] Nawaz Sharif will be buried,” Mr Rashid warned, adding that approaching a “closed tunnel” was not a wise step as it could lead to a “disastrously dangerous situation”.",negative
"Police said the Ahmadi family were offering prayers on Friday afternoon at their house in Murh Balochan area of Nankana when they heard a knock on the door. One of the family members, Dr Tahir Mahmood, 31, went to open the door where a teenage boy carrying a pistol opened fire on him. According to police, the victim suffered bullet wounds and fell on the ground, while his family members rushed to the door on hearing the gunshots. Police officials said the suspect also opened fire on them and injured Dr Mahmood’s father, Tariq, and uncles Saeed and Tayyab. Residents of the area subsequently nabbed the attacker. The injured were taken to a nearby hospital where Dr Mahmood succumbed to his injuries while his father was in critical condition. The deceased's two uncles suffered bullets wounds in their legs. Saddar Sanghla Station House Officer (SHO) Muhammad Shamshair told Dawn that the suspect was armed with a pistol and had knocked the Ahmadi family's door to attack them. He said the suspect was taken into custody who ""confessed to having attacked the family over religious differences"". SHO Shamshair said an investigation team was constituted that will thoroughly investigate the incident and will also check whether the suspect had attacked the house acting on his own or he was following somebody's instructions. Saleemuddin, the Ahmadi community's spokesperson, confirmed that the incident took place when the members of the family were gathered for prayers inside their home. “Ahmadis are not even safe inside their homes. They cannot perform their religious obligations inside the four walls of their home,” he said. The spokesperson said Ahmadis were being murdered at their doorsteps but the state had failed to provide them with any protection. He said the attack was a direct result of ""a hate campaign being run unchecked in the country"" against the community. Attacks targeting members of the Ahmadiya community have seen an uptick in recent months. Last month, an Ahmadi professor was shot dead in a targeted attack in Peshawar, allegedly over his religious beliefs. In July, an American national, Tahir Naseem, was shot dead by a teenager in a Peshawar courtroom. It later turned out that the deceased had reportedly left the Ahmadi community. On August 12, Meraj Ahmed, an Ahmadi trader, was shot dead by attackers in Peshawar's Gulbahar area. On September 10, a mob besieged the residence of an Ahmadi in the Phandu area of Peshawar and the family was rescued by police. However, one of the family members was arrested and charged with blasphemy. Ahmadis were declared non-Muslims in Pakistan through a constitutional amendment passed on September 7, 1974, during the tenure of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.",negative
"The truth is that politics cannot and should not preclude discussion of security matters and even criticism of it. Take American politics. Presidential elections have always partly been about security and foreign security matters. Candidates are discussed and attacked for their perceived weakness on security matters. Though elections, it is said, are fought and won on domestic agendas, no candidate wants to be seen to be weak internationally. No wonder then, till recently, the military experience of the candidates was considered essential — and its absence seen as a serious disadvantage. Similarly, no discussion of Jimmy Carter’s presidency is complete without an account of the Iran hostage crisis. But for obvious reasons, such a debate is not easy in Pakistan. Foreign policy in itself is rarely debated or discussed in the true sense of the word. There is little space to do this; political parties do not have the freedom to really thrash out issues and present or adopt different policy options. As a result, the foreign policy arena is simply used to attack opponents for their perceived ‘lack of patriotism’. In that sense, political debates on foreign policy are rather reminiscent of the debate on religious issues — if the debate is carried on only to establish oneself as a believer and the other as an unbeliever, there is little space for a healthy exchange of ideas but much room for hot air. It is for the political parties to sit at the same table and recognise each other as legitimate. Just consider the past few years. Foreign policy discussion has been reduced to determining who is scared of or close to India while being good at maintaining the past (good) relationship with China, Saudi Arabia and the US. So, more or less every government has been accused of kowtowing to India and angering the Chinese. Beyond this, it’s hard to think of a single instance of any nuance or detail. And since last year, the PTI government has been accused of having ceded space to India, which allowed the latter to carry out Balakot as well as change Kashmir valley’s status. Sadiq’s speech was no different. He — like the rest of his party — attacked the government and other stakeholders by implying cowardice. And it fit in well with his leader’s bayania (narrative) of identifying characters instead of institutions. He probably thought he would earn some brownie points with his own bosses. That his speech was used by the Indian media (as was Fawad Chaudhry’s) is beside the point. For it surely is a matter of cause and effect: was a speech attacked and dissected because of how the Indians perceived it or played it up or because one simply needs a reason to attack and question the sincerity of one player? But this entire debate — be it over who is the real Modi ka yaar or who was scared and worried in February 2019 — is irrelevant. The larger issue here remains that of the depths to which the parties are willing to go to attack each other, be it on domestic issues or foreign policy. Which is not to say that politics elsewhere doesn’t stink this much; it does. But the adverse and debilitating impact it has on Pakistan’s environment is because here the competition is not just between political parties. The fear hence is that if political parties are discredited, the vacuum will be exploited by others. The parties realised this in the post-1999 period, which eventually led to the Charter of Democracy. Among much else, the charter was about recognising each other as legitimate players. Consider point 21: “We will respect the electoral mandate of representative governments that accepts the due role of the opposition and declare neither shall undermine each other through extra-constitutional ways.” And to a large extent, the post-2008 period saw the PPP and the PML-N generally accepting each other’s role and space in the system. Till perhaps the second half of the PML-N government of 2013, this understanding existed to a large extent. But this bilateral acceptance did not include the PTI and neither was the PTI willing to accord this respect to the older parties. The present discord is a result of this lack of recognition or understanding. No wonder then that the name-calling and the exchange of harsh language is reminiscent of the 1990s. One side thinks the others are corrupt and dishonest while the latter think the former is selected and incompetent. And as the PTI tried to dislodge the PML-N government in 2014, the PDM, especially the PML-N, is not averse to a similar ending now. The centre and Sindh share a relationship which probably has parallels to Punjab under Nawaz Sharif and Islamabad under Benazir Bhutto. The coexistence in the 1990s was as ugly as it is now. By the time the 1999 coup happened, the PPP welcomed the ouster of an elected government. The question to be asked here is: can the solution at present be similar to what was settled earlier? By both sides (political parties all of them) accepting everyone’s right to exist and do politics? Indeed, if a dialogue is needed, it is for the political parties to sit at the same table and recognise each other as legitimate. The discussions for a dialogue between stakeholders and a truth and conciliation committee can perhaps wait till later. But the fear is that if the solution came after a coup had happened and both the PML-N and the PPP had been left out in the cold for years, this time around too it may come after considerable hardship. There is little evidence at the moment of any among the current leadership realising that this internecine conflict is producing no winners. And if this is so, the hostilities may continue for some time with little reprieve for the rest of us. The winter for the rest of us is far from over.",negative
"Some such adventure is unfolding in slow motion right before our eyes as the flash-and-bang of politics swallows the wholesome need for rational and timely decision-making. The business of the state waits for no one — not even the government. Crucial and pressing issues of national security are starved for political attention. On the table they sit, piling high by the day, while decision-makers, legislators and implementers wrestle each other to the ground. Thus is birthed the true legend of political irrelevance. The dossier tells its story even when it narrates another one. Last week, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and DG ISPR Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar addressed a press conference in which they unveiled substantive proofs of India’s state-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan. The dossier detailed information whose exactitude surpasses previous such official reports. This document is a major step within a larger attempt by Pakistan to reframe the narrative that India has peddled at our expense. This reframing is an evolving process that requires a whole-of-the-nation approach. It also requires a buy-in from key political stakeholders. For such a buy-in to happen, all have to be in the loop. The loop runs through a common understanding that national security matters should override partisan politicking. In the absence of such an understanding, there is no consensus, no consultation, no process and no outcome. Toxic politics, swirling around our landscape like a ferocious dust storm, is taking a heavy toll on the running of the state. Yet there cannot not be an outcome because the business of the state must go on. When it does go on, it surpasses, or bypasses, all those who are too busy wrestling in the political ring. The policy that emerges on the other side of this bypass, and the outcome it generates as a result of its implementation, can never have the efficacy it could have had — should have had — had it been enriched by bipartisan political nourishment. In the case of the dossier on Indian state-sponsored terrorism, political parties, including the ruling one, have a key role to play in terms of packaging it into a politically digestible narrative for domestic and external audiences. This narrative cannot be blanketed across this vast audience; rather it has to be injected into the veins of public opinion so that it seeps deep into the global bloodstream. This requires political finesse, and policy nuance, and a level of strategic communication that can command the kind of credibility that an informed international audience requires in this day and age. Try crafting all this inside a wrestling ring. Then there’s the delicate issue of according Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) a provisional provincial status. The matter is as complicated as it is critical within the existing national security matrix. At least one meeting with all political leaders present — except one — has been held to discuss the issue and forge a consensus. The absence of Prime Minister Imran Khan and the presence of the army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who played host, paints the predicament of this event for what it is. A second attempt was made by the Speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser to get all party leaders into the same room for a briefing on ostensibly the same issue. It was an ill-considered plan since the GB election campaign was underway at that time. It was also presented as a fait accompli to the opposition instead of bringing them on board earlier in terms of the agenda and expected outcomes. Had the prime minister — in his capacity as the leader of the house — agreed to attend the meeting? No one knew. The opposition rejected the invite. That was the end of the matter. Try crafting a consensus, with all its constitutional complexities attached, on the GB issue inside the wrestling ring. The list is long. Issue after issue desperate for attention and input; desperate for debate and decision; and desperate for options and solutions. On Covid-19 the role of political parties and parliament has been negligible. The National Command and Operation Centre became the nerve centre for the fightback against the virus because the government and the civilian apparatus appeared capacity-challenged in the face of the initial threat. That was nearly nine months ago. Throughout this period, key institutions that constitute our democratic governance structure — cabinets, parliaments, political parties — had no valuable input to give in the struggle against the pandemic. With the second wave rising ominously, all signs are that these institutions will keep themselves wrapped up in their silky cloak of irrelevance. Make no mistake: the vicious, hate-filled, and toxic politics, swirling around our landscape like a ferocious dust storm, is taking a heavy toll on the running of the state. This degradation of governance — for what else can one call this travesty — is pushing an already unstable polity into quasi-chaos. Weighty matters are being made light of; urgent issues are being left on the back-burner; and crucial decisions are being deferred for an indefinite time, all this because — and this is where it borders on criminal apathy — yes, all this because the fight against the opponent takes precedence over everything. Everything. We as a republic might as well go into the business of selling bananas. No nation-state worth its name would ridicule the art of statecraft as we are doing; and none would be oblivious of it as we are. The sheer juvenility of approach towards governance is distressing. And yet here we are, a nuclear armed state of 220 million citizens, stuck in a political traffic jam, honking away in fury. What do you do when there’s no cop in sight and no one wants to reverse first? The embrace of irrelevance is getting tighter by the day while the ring of wrestling is getting wider by the day. The two are interconnected in a macabre way that can only spell anxiety and disorder for a weakly governed republic.",negative
"The incident was the second of its kind in the area in less than a week’s time as last Saturday, the body of a four-year-old boy with ruptured abdomen was recovered in a neighbouring village. The girl’s body was found in Balukhel Bala area falling in the limits of the Badbher police station. The residents staged a protest against the incident and blocked the main Kohat Road for several hours. They dispersed in the evening after senior police officials assured them of the early arrest of the culprits. The police and residents told Dawn that the girl had gone missing at around 3pm on Wednesday, while her burnt body was found on Thursday morning. Peshawar SSP (operations) Mansoor Aman said the girl’s disappearance was reported to the local police station on Wednesday evening and that the police officials got in contact with her father the same day. He said the police also joined search for the missing girl in the area but the burnt body was found in a local graveyard on Thursday morning. SSP Aman said the city police had tasked their best officers with investigating the case, while teams had been formed to collect intelligence and forensic evidence and carry out profiling and investigations. Neighbour Hazrat Umar told Dawn that the girl, who was around seven, had gone missing at around 3pm on Wednesday. He said the girl had gone to a nearby shop after being given Rs10 by her grandfather, but she didn’t return. The neighbour said the family members began search for the girl soon after she disappeared, while the police were also informed about it. He said the girl’s body was spotted by a gravedigger. “The gravedigger saw fire inside the cemetery and when he got there, he found human remains in it,” he said, adding that the matter was reported to the police afterward. The police officials rushed to the graveyard and shifted the burnt body to the hospital for postmortem. Chief Minister Mahmood Khan also took notice of the murder and burning of the body and directed provincial police chief Dr Sanaullah Abbasi to ensure the early arrest of the culprit(s). Dr Abbasi called the girl’s father, expressed sorrow over the killing and assured him of the early arrest of the killer.",negative
"EVEN when Arzoo Raja’s case is decided, due to the contradictions in our colonial-Islamic hybrid legal regime, it is likely that the ambiguities affecting underage/interfaith marriages will remain. Since sexual relations are only permissible in marriage, there is no concept of ‘consent’ in our legal regime — only an age of marriage which is lower than the age of majority and which many do not consider binding. Neither is there a stable legal exit strategy from such marriages. Anti-colonial sentiment in Pakistan borrows from a patchwork of reformist Islamic traditions, orientalism, and Indian (male) postcolonial studies. It ignores the indigenous patriarchy of Indian male nationalism, denies the agency of the rebellious woman-subject, while glorifying orthodox resistance to colonial values. The myth that religio-nationalism was a reflex action or born of insecurity is debunked by positive campaigns initiated by Indian male reformers for liberal rights, and collusion of conservative men with colonial legal practices. It downplays how women often benefited from a more level playing field that relied on text, not custom, when defying community and class injustice. Courts often align with majoritarian religious sentiments. Indian feminists have argued that no ideal British womanhood was imposed on India since Victorian feminism was challenging patriarchy in Britain. Historians note how English judges concurred with Indian legal and nationalist opinion that patriarchal customs should influence law and exempted local marriage systems and husbands from blame. Disputes in Muslim marriages were considered private matters while restitution of conjugal rights was granted to men. When women found inventive ways to inherit property, the laws of inheritance were amended to dispossess them of such rights. Efforts to raise the age of consent (and for civil marriage) were initiated by Indian, not colonial, reformers and opposed by religious nationalists. Despite numerous deaths of underage married girls, it was only after 11-year-old Phulmonee died in agony due to marital rape that the colonial rulers reluctantly passed the Age of Consent Act, 1891. (Bengali) Brahmins protested this as intrusive since they considered infant marriage sacrosanct. Inspired by this, women of all religious communities temporarily bonded to campaign for the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929. Even if child marriage cases did reach the courts and girls testified non-consent, British judges feared convictions would offend custom. Moreover, consent was biologically determined, not on the basis of freedom of choice. These legacies are recycled here. In 1997, Asma Jahangir successfully defended Saima Waheed’s right as a Muslim woman to marry without the approval of a wali, but objected to the grudging judgement of the Lahore High Court which referred to a protective Sharia and invoked the role of judges as “custodians of the morals of Pakistan’s citizens”, while ranking cultural and communal values above Western individualism. While some applauded this as an example of Islamic egalitarianism, the LHC continued to deny nearly 250 couples the freedom to marry by consent, through pendency of appeals, until Asma Jahangir appealed to the Supreme Court which ruled against this conduct in 2003. In cases of inter-faith or underage marriages, courts often align with majoritarian religious sentiments that privilege puberty over a secular determined age of marriage, reflected in the decision to solicit medical evidence to prove Arzoo’s age instead of relying on Nadra documents. Consent should be determined by the woman’s claim and documented age and not by invasive tactics or at the discretion of courts. History reveals how Indian men recuperated power on the pretext of anti-colonial politics. Prior to 1938, an Indian Muslim woman’s only recourse to divorce was through renouncing her faith because of the limitations imposed by religious laws and non-Muslim rule. The 1939 Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act was drafted by Maulana Thanawi to prevent this crisis of women leaving the faith and not for conferring rights. Today, Muslim women converts are threatened with charges of apostasy if their marriages are annulled by courts, or if they later divorce and want to revert to their original faith. Virtue-signallers support select liberal causes against the death penalty, blasphemy laws and child marriage but evade and rebuke any criticism of the drivers of majoritarianism as, ‘liberal-secular-enlightenment’ excess. The insistence that underage/coerced marriages should be automatically annulled does not advise how to separate religious from secular legal reasoning. Court marriages can be a relief but unless a civil marriage law is enacted, women’s independent religious freedoms remain under threat. Consent should not be a biological concern exploited by minority and majority communities or dependent on judicial discretion but about women’s informed choices.",negative
"IN a rather strange presentation of the facts, the government told us this week that the economy is doing well and they are preparing for talks with the IMF. I always thought the IMF is where you go when the economy is not doing well. Here are some things the prime minister’s special adviser on finance, Hafeez Shaikh, and the minister information, Shibli Faraz, said during the press conference in which they discussed the forthcoming IMF talks. We were told there is “positive news on the economic front from all sides”. That matters under discussion with the IMF were showing improvement, such as “better revenue collection”, reduction in government expenditure and paying off debts. “Good news is pouring in from all four sides and we need to protect it from coronavirus and build on it,” Shaikh said. Shibli Faraz went a step further, saying “all basic economic indicators have moved in the right direction over the past one month and there is a feel-good factor in the market as evident from the stock market, foreign direct investment and large-scale manufacturing (LSM) data”. The economy is full of air at the moment, and that is what is driving this ‘feel-good factor’. So the economy is growing, the stock market is rising, revenues are up, debts are being paid off, expenditures are restrained, the power sector is being reformed and the prime minister himself is leading on this front (according to Shaikh) and foreign investors are pouring in, food inflation is set to fall since wheat stocks are adequate and so on. Then why, dear sirs, is your government talking to the IMF? Fact is the economy is puffed up, full of air at the moment, and that is what is driving this “feel-good factor” that makes it appear like things are actually improving. How can he describe revenue collection as good when it is lagging behind nominal GDP growth? Take the first quarter as an example, where tax revenues increased by 2.5 per cent of GDP but nominal GDP growth was 3.5pc. And remember that a 1pc gap is equal to Rs440 billion. Notice how the indicator deflates rapidly when placed in the proper context. Similar is the case of exports that is also being touted by the government as some sort of a signature success. Aside from the remarks by Messrs Shaikh and Faraz on Tuesday claiming exports have increased, the government separately tweeted out two screenshots based on a Bloomberg article claiming exports have grown by 7pc in September, faster than India and Bangladesh, because of the prime minister’s decision to open exporting units early by exempting them from lockdown restrictions as far back as April. But the claim is built on export shipments, not export proceeds. The sheer quantity of exports, if measured in terms of the number of containers or in weight of the consignments, may well have increased. However, State Bank data shows export proceeds in the first quarter of the fiscal year, running from July to September, actually declined more than 10pc. For the month of October, we have to look at Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data (since State Bank has not yet released theirs), which is based on customs valuations of the cargoes (as opposed to amounts received by banks as in the case of State Bank data), which saw an increase of just over 4pc compared to October last year. When measured in dollars, exports are not showing an increase worthy of being touted as a big success. One thing to note is the large increase in the number of export consignments and the comparatively smaller increase in export proceeds. This means we are exporting more cargo and earning fewer dollars against the volumetric increase. And this merits comment. The relatively small increase in dollar receipts on exports could be due to steeper discounts that exporters have to offer to their customers to secure their orders. But this trend has been there for a number of years now — volumetric increases coupled with relatively smaller dollar receipts — and my hunch is that there is rampant under-invoicing going on. If true, this would mean the exporters are taking the full benefit of all the subsidies and other incentives the government has lavished upon them, with the bulk of their money kept abroad. The telling instance is the ongoing appreciation of the exchange rate. Whenever the rupee rises against the dollar and the trend looks like it is set to continue, we usually see large amounts of dollars hoarded abroad through trade misdeclaration making their way back through a variety of channels. It returns either as remittances, foreign investment into the stock market, or into government debt instruments, since these are usually channels through which undeclared money can be whitened. Upon its return, this sort of money most often looks to find its way into the property market. So if you see people who own large export units and are also known players in property markets via owning housing societies, egging the prime minister on to open avenues for black money to enter into property investment without questions being asked, it is fair to wonder whether we are in fact witnessing the round-tripping of dollar hoards acquired through misdeclaration of trade seeking their way into another speculative racket (property), which in turn is being pumped up through more government incentives. Fact of the matter is the economy is riding on a mini bubble, pumped through massive government inducements, and whether or not this can last is being decided at the IMF table. Soon they will have to face reality, and get to work unwinding the circular debt through tariff increases, getting the revenue effort going through an earnest tax effort and cut the largesse being showered on industry, including the amnesty scheme that lies at the heart of the so-called ‘construction package’. We will see where this nascent growth story stands once all this is done.",negative
"I HOPE by now people realise that this never ends. For the past two years, we have seen one sector of the economy after another get hit by price spirals, attributed largely to a steep mismatch between supply and demand (or between cost of provision of goods versus the recovery made from sales of the goods), the supply chains are in deep disarray in one area after another. Today, just as it seems that we are hitting a plateau in food prices, another supply-demand mismatch in the gas sector threatens to create shortages and yet another price spiral as some of the most expensive imported gas has just been contracted by the government, at rates ranging between 16 to 18 per cent of Brent crude where the price of contract gas (purchased through the long-term supply arrangements negotiated by the previous government and subjected to much maligning by the present government) is just above 13pc. Importing this gas is the easy part. The hard part will be figuring out how to divide up the losses since the full cost of imported gas (especially at these rates) cannot be passed through to the end consumers, whether in industry or in homes. In the last price notification of RLNG, the price at the port was just under $4.6 for cargoes brought by PSO and just under $4 per unit for cargoes brought by the state-owned Pakistan LNG Ltd. This gas was then sold by SNGPL, the distribution company for Punjab and KP provinces, at a weighted average price just under $6.5 per unit. This was when the base price was between 11pc and 13pc of Brent crude. Let’s see what happens when the weighted price is between 16pc and 18pc. On top of this the cotton crop is coming in weaker than ever in recent memory. Cotton ginners are saying they expect the total crop to come in around five million bales, where the requirements of the country’s textile industry are put closer to 15m bales. The resulting gap will need to be made up by imports. Once those imports kick in, along with their pricing, coupled with the 1.7m tonnes of wheat the country is looking to import by January, the pressures will be felt on the reserves as well as input prices of industry. The rising price spirals are the result of the government’s inability to get a handle on things. In last week’s cabinet meeting, the government’s finance adviser, Hafeez Shaikh, is reported to have warned his colleagues about the mushrooming growth of “superfluous subsidies” being given to industry to help kick-start growth. In the cabinet meeting this week, held only a few days ago, the prime minister’s own adviser on revenues, the venerable Q block veteran Waqar Masud, once again warned about the mushrooming subsidies bill, laying the emphasis on power subsidies in the area of power where the government has already decided to provide Rs21bn to subsidise electricity for industry, and use funds earmarked for Covid-19 support for the purpose. To power subsidies, we should now be prepared to add gas, wheat and cotton subsidies as well. Otherwise there will be another round of food price inflation, and the rising cost of cotton might adversely impact exports. Last winter, to take one example, they subsidised LNG imports and provided the gas at cheaper than the procurement price. Today, as a result of subsidising LNG, the gas companies have a debt burden of Rs78 billion according to some reports. If they decide to continue with subsidising LNG for the industrial sector again through this winter (and they have already contracted six cargoes for December and are advertising for another six in January), the gas companies estimate they could be burdened with another Rs69bn. This is what we get for not managing the gas supply chain properly. In January last year, when the gas shortages were biting hard, the prime minister sacked the heads of the two large gas companies in the middle of the crisis to express his displeasure. That act, executed more out of anger than rational thinking, did not prevent the government from mismanaging gas supplies one more time, delaying the orders for imported LNG till the price in international markets was higher than the contract price at which we currently buy LNG, and laying the groundwork for another crisis all over again.This never ends because it is not the product of fortuitous circumstances. The government is not a victim here. This state of affairs, of rising price spirals happening everywhere from medicines to food to fuel to power, is fundamentally the result of the government’s inability to get a handle on things. And that inability is not going away, rather it is increasing as the political temperature rises. This is what happens when the government is too busy shouting at the opposition on TV screens and rallies and not paying attention to what is happening under its nose, as procurement targets fall short and gas supplies are not arranged and medicine prices are tampered with after listening only to the teary-eyed entreaties of big pharma and power-sector recoveries fall while the circular debt rises and so on. The economy is now caught in a swindle without an end. Like a shoal of piranhas, vested interests everywhere are swindling the state to reap rentier-scale profits that create turbulence which the state has to dampen. The results of this mismanagement pile up either in the state’s subsidy bill, or at the consumer’s doorstep in the form of higher prices. Already they are being pushed to pass the circular debt through to end consumers, and the Petroleum Division (whose minister gave us this circular debt in his old role as power minister) is warning of another circular debt in fuels that might also need to be passed through to end consumers. As things stand, this state of constant lurching from one crisis to another, from one set of shortages to another, from one price spiral to another, will never end.",negative
"BY all reported accounts, Tuesday’s cabinet meeting seems to have been a raucous affair. Cabinet members chided their own colleagues for the continuing spiral in food prices, while those in the crosshairs of the criticism blamed the rains, the Sindh government and the lethargic pace at which the bureaucracy moved on the crisis. According to reports coming out of the cabinet session, Prime Minister Imran Khan was upset that his directives from April to begin imports of wheat were not followed up on. Let’s note two things about this observation. First, those directives were issued more than six months ago. And the prime minister is asking after their non-implementation now? Second, along with those directives there was a commitment to take action against those who profited from the food price increase last year. These were his exact words: “I await the detailed forensic reports now by the high-powered commission, which will come out on 25 April, before taking action. InshaAllah, after these reports come out no powerful lobby will be able to profiteer at the expense of our public.” This was on the morning of April 5, 2020. A full 205 days lie between that date and the date of the cabinet meeting, in which he once again vowed to bring prices down again. What action have we seen on the inquiry commission reports released in April, besides a small cabinet reshuffle and suspension of one provincial bureaucrat? While the prime minister is busy asking why his directives issued 205 days ago were not implemented, the rest of us can ask what happened to his own promise of action against those named in the report. We had a vow of action not once but twice — action against those responsible for the price spiral. And yet, here we are again… When we had a food price spiral in the same months last year we were told inquiries had been launched and “no powerful lobby will be able to profiteer at the expense of our public” again. Then the same mistakes that led to last year’s price spiral were repeated one more time this year. And here we are once again, in the midst of another food price spiral, owing to the same causes as last year’s, but with price increases that are even more fierce than they were at that time. It doesn’t end there. Back in February of this year, the prime minister vowed that “come what may, my govt will be announcing various measures that will be taken to reduce prices of basic food items for the common man in Cabinet on Tuesday.” That cabinet meeting was held on Feb 11, a full 259 days before Tuesday’s cabinet meeting. And the “come what may” vow was followed up with this: “The nation should rest assured that all those responsible will be held accountable & penalised.”So we had a vow of action not once but twice — action against those responsible for the price spiral, as well as action to bring the prices under control. And yet here we are again, 259 days later, riding the same price spiral, listening to the same blame game, seeing the same fist-thumping one more time. On Oct 10, a little more than a fortnight ago, while the price spiral continued, Hammad Azhar who as minister industries is responsible for the sugar sector, told us that “South Asia has witnessed a temporary food inflation spike.” The words were accompanied with a graph, with two lines on it, one blue (for India) and one black (for Pakistan) saying this is the food inflation in both countries. There was no source given for where the data came from, but both lines seemed to track each other closely. The implication clearly was that rising food prices are a global phenomenon. He went on to repeat the vow that government would do what it could to arrest this price spiral. “Govt will take all measures needed to reduce prices of essential commodities [sic]. Imported wheat and sugar will be released at control rates by provinces. All options are being examined for other commodities.” Four days later, he followed this up with another observation, and repeated the vow of action. “International food prices have risen post covid supply disruptions,” he said and attached a graph, this time with the source given as Bloomberg, showing the price of agri futures contracts rising from June onwards. Sceptics at the time pointed out two things. First that he was showing figures for future deliveries, and second that the peak of 2020 was below the peak of 2019, which meant prices from last year had actually come down slightly in the very markets the graph was depicting. But be that as it may, he followed up this observation by vowing that “federal and provincial governments will take administrative and fiscal measures to stabilise prices of essential commodities”. This was on Oct 14, about a fortnight ago. Then yesterday he told us that “TCP has imported sugar at most competitive rates from intl markets without any govt subsidy involved. It will also be sold in the market by Punjab Govt at prices much below the current retail and ex-mill rates.” So if international prices were rising and driving the food price spiral in the country, how did the TCP manage to import sugar which can be sold “below the current retail and ex-mill rates”? And without “any govt subsidy involved”? Fact of the matter is, if you look up all the public pronouncements issued by various ministers of this government since August, by when it was abundantly clear that wheat procurement had missed its target, that shortages were looming, and the price spiral had taken off in earnest, you will notice something. One day they’re blaming the opposition. In their next press conference they’re blaming the weather, untimely rains, locusts, international prices and so on. Along with this they’re vowing action, taking notice, unleashing the Tiger Force, warning profiteers and so on. One thing they are not doing is learning how to run things.",negative
"KARACHI: One unanticipated by product of the Supreme Court’s detailed judgement in the Qazi Faez Isa case is how money laundering has suddenly been cast in a clear legal light. Paragraphs 107, 108 and 109 of the judgement dwell at length on whether or not the petitioner has committed money laundering by not disclosing the assets in question in his wealth statements. The apex court finds that under the law in force — Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010 (AMLA) — that “a necessary element of the offence of money laundering is the commission of a predicate offence.” These predicate offenses are listed in the schedule attached to the law. “The execution of this offence gives birth to the proceeds of crime, the movement of which attracts the criminal conduct of money laundering” the judges assert. It follows, therefore, that “without the commission of a predicate offence there can be no offence of money laundering.” Not all statutory violations can be used to invoke the charge of money laundering, the court says. Only those offenses listed in the Schedule to the Act can. “A perusal of the Schedule reveals that the non-declaration of assets by a taxpayer under the Ordinance is not a predicate offence under AMLA” the court says. On this ground, the court finds that no case of money laundering can be made against the petitioner in this case, since “no predicate offence has been alleged against the petitioner”. “In the above factual scenario, an allegation of money laundering against the petitioner is entirely fictional at this stage” the court says. Moreover, the court also says that the Schedule identifying the predicate offences was issued in 2016, that “it is an established fact that before 2016, violations of the Ordinance could not form the basis of a money laundering allegation” The findings have ramifications beyond the case itself. “It is a welcome development that the SC has clarified something which is internationally recognized and is also a part of AMLA, which unfortunately in the past has been misinterpreted and misrepresented by the government, at times for political motivations, by focusing only on the asset when failing to identify or provide any evidence, of the actual corrupt action, such as official acts in exchange for money or benefits, which would then be the source of the laundered assets” says Zahid Jamil, who as a former special public prosecutor for the FIA was one of the first lawyers to use and defend AMLA before the courts. Business persons have often found themselves charged with money laundering in cases of simple undisclosed incomes or assets, says Shabbar Zaidi, former FBR chair and prominent chartered accountant. “At the moment any discovery of an undeclared asset or income of a business is treated as money laundering by the authorities, whereas this was actually a case of undisclosed income” he says. “Now the Supreme Court has made it clear that there can be no money laundering without a predicate offence, and these predicate offences are recognised only after 2016, means the charge of money laundering will no longer be applied in cases of undisclosed incomes and assets.”",negative
"THERE is this pesky thing about reality — it always finds a way to assert itself. You can muzzle it, deny it and spin it away but it will always catch up with you eventually. Perhaps that’s why we call it reality, because it doesn’t go away simply because somebody in a position of power or influence orders it to go away. And for any ruler there are two realities that simply cannot be muzzled, denied or spun away: economics and war. Take one example of how reality is being spun to try and put a little shine on things. On Wednesday, when the rest of the country was still debating the fallout of the Karachi jalsa, the prime minister tweeted the following: “Great news for Pakistan. We are headed in right direction finally. Current Account was in surplus of $73 mn during Sept, bringing surplus for 1st qtr to $792 mn compared to deficit of $1,492 mn during same time last yr. Exports grew 29pc & remittances grew 9pc over previous month.” Read: Pakistan sees record 1Q current account surplus This is spin, pure and simple, and there is an easy way to show that. Look at how the data is presented. For the current account balance (which is in surplus) the data is compared to the same period last year. For exports and remittances — the two key elements in the current account — the data is compared to the preceding months. The impression this creates is one of overall improvement. ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER AD But let’s invert this presentation for a moment and see what happens. Let’s compare the current account balance to the preceding months and remittances and exports to the same period last year instead and see what happens. Notice how the shine goes off the numbers if you invert the manner in which they are presented. In July, August and September, the three months under discussion, the current account balance was in surplus by $508 million, $211m and $72m respectively. In case you missed the significance, on a month-to-month basis the surplus is actually shrinking, and rather rapidly. Let’s discuss why a little later. Next up, if you compare exports and remittances in the month of September from the same month last year, you will notice that exports rose this year by $72m, or 3.8 per cent of their value last year. This is not exactly a triumphant increase. Remittances in the month of September saw an increase of $544m from last year, or just above 31pc. The thing to note in the data is the $417m increase in the trade deficit in September, which is almost 29pc, or just about the same as the increase in remittances. It is not clear whether or not this increase in remittances owes itself to any government policy yet, so let’s wait before celebrating it as a major triumph of any sort, but we can note this simple reality: the remittances are financing the trade deficit. Notice how the shine goes off the numbers if you invert the manner in which they are presented. The current account was helped along by a near collapse in imports during the months of the Covid-19 lockdowns, and now that those are receding, oil prices are regaining their earlier levels, the surplus that was posted in July and August is shrinking. The bigger point is that nothing in the underlying economy has changed so if the government guns for growth at this point the current account deficit will reappear with a vengeance. Anytime you see any government loudly celebrating individual data points, telling you to rejoice because reserves are up this week or the current account deficit is down, or whatever, you can be sure that they have no real story of success to tell and are leaping from one data release to the other as if they are stepping stones that actually lead somewhere. If you look at all the data points that they have invoked in the past and urged us to rejoice, you will realise that the story of the economy is not going anywhere as of right now. I have said it in the past and it bears repeating: deficit reduction is not the key here. Of course deficits need to be reduced when an economy has depleted its foreign exchange reserves or blown all its fiscal buffers to the point where its debt levels have hit unsustainable heights. Where exactly that point lies is a subjective judgement though. There are examples from our very own neighbourhood of countries that have persistently run deficits in their fiscal and current accounts for almost three decades now without depleting their reserves (or at least nowhere near as often as Pakistan has) and without blowing out their fiscal balance sheet. India and Bangladesh stand out as examples, as to a lesser extent Sri Lanka and Nepal too. In Pakistan what matters is what we do after the deficits have been reduced. Every government in the past 30 years has begun its term in office by reducing the current account deficit, and in some cases, the scale of the reduction has been larger than what the current government is boasting. There is nothing unusual in this. It happens every time in the first year of an IMF programme. Perhaps the only unusual thing for this government is that it will have two first years of an IMF programme in two years, given they are about to negotiate a return to the programme and present a circular debt reduction plan as well as a tax plan for the ongoing fiscal year. The reality is that this government is adrift. There is no vision at play, whether for tax reform or on state-owned enterprises. We are told something has been developed for the power sector, but the test of this plan will be their ability to arrest and reduce the circular debt without recourse to tariff hikes. Reality is asserting itself now, in the data as well as the streets. Time to end the rhetoric.",negative
"IT is worth noting that this is the second food price spiral that this government has presided over. Last year when the same thing happened the government ordered an inquiry, and people are invited to recall that with much sound and fury, and two inquiry reports were released back in April of this year, one of sugar and another on wheat. Much angry rhetoric was exchanged after that. A head even rolled, sort of, when Jahangir Tareen had to appear on TV to try and clear his name and then silently, in the still night, depart the country for London, that perennial bastion of those on the lam from trouble in their own country. The other person named in the report was none other than the country’s own minister for national food security, Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar. The latter did not feel compelled to flee though. He was transferred out of his position into another, and there ended his troubles. At the time Prime Minister Imran Khan had tweeted the following lines and I quote them verbatim to ensure there is no misunderstanding. “As promised preliminary reports into sudden price hikes of sugar & wheat have been released immed without alteration/tampering. This is unprecedented in Pak’s history. Prev pol ldrships bec of their vested interests & compromises lacked moral courage to order & release such reports. I await the detailed forensic reports now by the high-powered commission, which will come out on 25 April, before taking action. InshaAllah, after these reports come out no powerful lobby will be able to profiteer at the expense of our public.” In the days that followed, these talking points were repeated over and over again on TV talk shows, press conferences and other public remarks of the party leadership. Their government had taken the “unprecedented step” of inquiring into such a price hike, of releasing the reports. Their government will now, after the detailed forensic reports are released, take further action against all culprits. After all this is said and done, “no powerful lobby will be able to profiteer at the expense of our public”. Apparently, powerful lobbies are not deterred by inquiry reports, triumphant tweets and angry rhetoric. And here we are, not more than six months later, at exactly the same point in time when last year’s price spiral got going, living through the same thing all over again. Apparently, powerful lobbies are not deterred by inquiry reports, triumphant tweets and angry rhetoric. Back then, they first blamed the Sindh government, and they are doing the same today. They blamed previous governments too, and will do so again now that we have a possibly dangerous cocktail of food price hikes and the commencement of an opposition street protest campaign. They’ve already invoked Covid-19 to try and dissuade the opposition from holding its protest gatherings, saying these run the risk of spreading the infection. Meanwhile, the prime minister had no issue attending and addressing a large gathering of his own party’s lawyer wing held at the convention centre, Islamabad. I wonder how strictly social distancing and masking was observed at that gathering. The inquiry reports released back in April identified weak procurement by the government up till the summer of 2019 for the ensuing wheat price spiral in the winter months of that year as the core reason why the price spiral happened. Then in April 2020 the report was released, and by July we began hearing the same kind of news coming out of successive government meetings as we had heard in the previous year. Those with an ear to the ground could smell trouble back in July, when procurement targets were again being missed by provincial and federal governments, wheat imports were opened up, and then in what seemed like a deliberate attempt, skewed in such a way as to only allow a few big importers to avail the facility. When the ECC made the decision to remove all ceilings from wheat imports in an attempt to keep the market properly supplied in the face of weak procurement domestically, import permits began being issued for batches of 500,000 tons per consignment, instead of keeping the door open to anybody who wished to import wheat. This automatically eliminated all but the largest parties from being able to participate in wheat imports. Reportedly at the time the finance adviser Hafeez Shaikh was angry about this, and asked why this was being done, but it is not clear whether he ever received a satisfactory answer. By August the spiral got underway in earnest, and just like a repeat of last year, the government began by blaming Sindh, the only province controlled by an opposition party. Then on Aug 12 the information minister told us that it was the “top priority” of the government to keep flour prices stable, that nobody would be allowed to sell at a higher price, that the prime minister had taken strict notice, chaired a meeting on prices of daily-use items, including but not limited to sugar and flour, that regular meetings were being held, that provincial authorities had been issued instructions, and so on. Then he gave us some prices, saying a 20-kg flour bag was being sold in KP at Rs900 to Rs1,150 and in Karachi (Sindh) at up to Rs1,700. This was in August. At his press conference on Tuesday, he gave the following prices for a 20kg bag of flour: in KP between Rs1,100 and Rs1,300; in Sindh between Rs1,100 and Rs1,500. Notice the price has increased in KP and decreased in Sindh, as per the minister’s own figures. On Aug 24, the minister industries, Hammad Azhar, told us that with imports landing at the ports, prices of essential items would come down. They didn’t. And now the prime minister himself announced that he has taken notice once again and that starting from Monday, Oct 12, his own Tiger Force will work to bring down prices. The only question left to ask is this: do the rulers think that running the country is a joke?",negative
"IS it possible to pursue economic stability while at the same time imparting massive volatility to the theatre of politics? The simple answer is yes, but at tremendous cost to the country and especially the poor. The present government now has to tackle this double challenge. They are engaged in talks with the IMF for resumption of the programme, which is already delayed since it was supposed to have restarted by September. At the heart of these talks are two critical plans the government has to present. The first is a revenue plan to convince the Fund that they have a credible road map on how to curb the fiscal deficit that for the second year in a row has come in above eight per cent of GDP, a manifestly unsustainable position. The second plan is on the circular debt that has crossed Rs2 trillion and is mounting faster than it ever has before (though the government argues that in recent months the acceleration is due to disrupted recoveries on account of Covid-19 lockdowns). It is in this context that the government has appointed Waqar Masud as special assistant to the prime minister on revenue. A Q-block veteran and an old associate of Hafeez Shaikh (with whom he will be working), the appointment is a clear indication that the government is reaching out for assistance on building its revenue plan in the context of the IMF talks. On the circular debt side we were told that Shahzad Qasim, the former SAPM on power, was in the advanced stages of drawing up a plan until news arrived that he had been replaced by Tabish Gauhar, former chairman of K-Electric and senior member of the Abraaj Capital team that oversaw the management takeover of the power utility back in 2009. It is not clear what this handover of charge means for the ongoing efforts to draw up a circular debt curtailment plan, but if Gauhar decides to turn the clock back and chalk out his own road map rather than continue with what Qasim was already working with, it could prolong the talks. We will have to wait to see. At the same time as these talks, and the efforts to draw up the plans necessary to satisfy the Fund, are continuing, a massive confrontation seems to be brewing between the government and the opposition parties, especially after the registration of sedition cases against the leadership of the opposition. The government would have us believe that it has nothing to do with the registration of these cases, that they have been registered by a private individual in his private capacity. Then it transpires that the individual in question is supposedly a worker of the ruling party and numerous images start circulating of him shaking hands and smiling broadly with various party leaders, especially Chaudhry Sarwar, the present governor Punjab. Then surprisingly the name of one of the people mentioned in the FIR — Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Raja Muhammad Farooq — is struck off at the behest of the Punjab government, but the rest of the names are left in place. Even as efforts are being made to draw up the plans necessary to satisfy the IMF, a massive political storm is brewing. So the government had nothing to do with filing these FIRs accusing two former prime ministers of the country of ‘sedition’ based on logic so specious that only a handful of people in the country can claim to understand it? And it is a sheer coincidence, is it, that these FIRs are registered two days after the prime minister himself accuses Nawaz Sharif of “playing India’s game” and his own people are all over the airwaves advancing the idea that Sharif is a tool in the hands of the country’s enemies? As if this was not enough, the other big party from the opposition — the PPP — has had fresh ‘corruption’ references filed against its leadership, including former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and the former president Asif Zardari. The timing is unlikely to be a coincidence, as these developments come right after the formation of the anti-government Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance — the name has close resonance to the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy in the early 1980s. So the order of battle is falling in place between the government and the opposition, with each side escalating matters towards a confrontation. Meanwhile, the government’s own people are preparing to sit across the table from the IMF team and present credible plans for how they intend to raise more revenues, cut spending, raise recoveries in the power sector, adjust fuel prices to reflect global market realities, and arrest what looks like accelerating inflation. At the same time, as the confrontation with the opposition (should it come to that) will be taking off, the government may well be signing off onto another adjustment programme, though perhaps not as harsh as the one it had to implement in its first year considering foreign exchange reserves are not in as dire a position today as they were back in August 2018. Some in the top echelons of the leadership apparently understand this. Reports in the media suggest that in the cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, some ministers raised concerns about the brewing confrontation while at the same time underlining rising inflation as a critical problem. In the days to come they will be adding rising tax burden, interest rates, currency depreciation, fuel and power price hikes to this list as well. We will see how much of an appetite for confrontation remains once the economic realities begin to assert themselves, one more time. Without any political buy-in, the only way to make macroeconomic stabilisation happen is through the bluntest of instruments, like interest rates and fuel and power pricing and taxation. Never mind tax reform for now. Never mind power-sector governance. Never mind privatisation of large entities like PIA or Steel Mill. When politics soaks up the oxygen, there is no space left for policy.",negative
"AMID all the noise and fury of the past week, a number fluttered through the news flow without much comment but with a big story behind it. It came from the State Bank that said something like Rs1.58 trillion — equal to 3.8 per cent of the country’s GDP — has been injected into “the cash flow of businesses and households” since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Pause here for a moment to absorb the full meaning of these words, and consider a few things. First, the lion’s share of this largesse has been enjoyed by “the cash flow of businesses” and not by households. Second, this amount relates only to what the State Bank has injected through various monetary measures — which include interest rate cuts alongside subsidised credit and loan deferments — and does not include the Rs1.24tr “relief package” announced by the government on March 24 only days after the lockdowns began. Third, this amount has been injected directly into the veins of the country’s business and industrial elites in a period of less than six months. Combined with the fiscal stimulus administered by the government (separately from the State Bank) this represents one of the largest transfers of wealth from public to private hands in such a short period of time ever undertaken in the country’s history. Not all of the Rs1.58tr announced by the State Bank is public money moving to private hands though. The single largest amount under this total is loan deferments given by private banks to private creditors, which the State Bank counts as “supervisory actions” that (presumably) do not imply the use of any subsidised credit. But the monetary policy statement in which the State Bank gave its trillion-and-a-half-rupee figure says that “private sector credit has recently been supported to a significant extent by SBP refinance facilities”. The question is: how much was given to whom in the name of fighting the pandemic and helping the poor? Of course, one cannot begrudge the fact that the government undertook extraordinary steps in order to deal with an extraordinary situation. After all, every country in the world took stimulus measures to keep their economy afloat through the lockdowns. What is necessary to consider though, is the details of how much was given to whom in the name of fighting the pandemic and helping the poor. It is entirely possible that many business enterprises would not have been able to survive had it not been for these measures, especially the loan deferments and the interest rate reductions. But the amounts involved are truly stupendous and given how the story has shaped up on the fiscal side of the stimulus, it is perhaps necessary to ask who availed what share of the benefits from these monetary measures. The fiscal stimulus that was announced back in March shaped up very differently to what was initially announced. To start with, we had a figure of Rs1.24tr to be given in the name of the poor. But when looked at more carefully, it turned out the figure itself was misleading. It contained Rs280 billion for wheat procurement, an activity that is undertaken every year as a matter of routine, as well as Rs150bn as tax refunds for industry, which was money that had been illegally withheld from industry in the first place and never belonged to the government. These were routine allocations and should not have been presented as an extraordinary stimulus of any sort. But those were heady days and the people in power did not take kindly to quibbles about a quarter trillion here or there. ‘Here we are fighting a historic battle and you’re counting up the money?’ they would ask. So not many questions were asked and the general perception was allowed to pass itself to the public’s consciousness that the government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, was gearing up to spend a historic amount of money to support the poor in the midst of a pandemic. Then came the modifications and the deflections from the course originally announced. Those of us who followed the money always knew this, but the finance ministry recently conceded that Rs540bn from the stimulus remained unutilised. Recall that the original amount was misleadingly presented as Rs1.24tr, when in reality the amount of the stimulus was closer to Rs775bn when those measures that should never have been packaged as ‘stimulus measures’ were removed. The unspent amount helped lower the fiscal deficit from the dire predictions, but even more importantly, when you looked carefully at where money was spent and where it was withheld, it became evident that something else was happening. First we saw money being diverted from its intended purpose towards entirely different purposes, such as when the government allowed the use of money from the relief package to be used for paying power-sector interest payments. The biggest sleight of hand that was slipped past the people was the sudden change of the Covid relief package into a subsidy for the pump-and-dump rackets that prevail in the property markets, under the guise of “housing for the poor” and jumpstarting the economy and providing jobs for daily wagers. At the heart of this sleight of hand was an amnesty scheme for undeclared black assets in cash to move freely into property developments, with ‘no questions asked’. So much for fighting the pandemic. So much for the poor. It is now critical to take deeper stock of how the various stimulus measures undertaken by the government and the State Bank have fared in reality. Who got how much, and what were the opportunity costs and trade-offs involved? It was only a short while into the implementation of the stimulus package that the prime minister delivered his speech announcing an opening of the economy with the words “we cannot feed the poor forever”. Hindsight tells us why this was so, because they had the rich to feed instead, and their appetites are far larger than those of the poor.",negative
"THERE are those among us who think politics is about nothing but taunting your opponents. These are precisely the sorts of weaklings who feel strong and emboldened when they are part of a group, but shrivel up into diminutive creatures when caught out alone. We all know the type, even if from school days. For days and days as the city of Karachi grappled with a historic flood and a crippling power outage that sent consequences cascading in every direction — from cellular network outages to ATM and fuel pump closures — there was this lot among us who thought the opportunity demands nothing more from them than to taunt the provincial government. On Saturday, many areas of the city were still in the thick of the power outage, the lucky ones jostling for generator fuel at those few pumps that were open but mobbed, the rest either suffering through 48 hours without power or seeking refuge in the houses of those whose power had been restored. That same night, just 12 minutes shy of the midnight hour, our power minister tweeted the following line. “Strongly recommend that PPP Sind Govt and Officers visit Mohenjo Daro and Harappa to study the drainage & sewerage system used there 4500 years ago.” There is not much one can say about the mindset which leads people to hurl taunts, abuse and mockery at those who are beset by difficulties. When this tweet was sent, large parts of the country’s largest city, the beating heart of its economy, had been without power for 60 hours. Think about that for a moment. I was one of the lucky ones whose generator had not broken down from such continuous running, but had spent a good amount of the day rushing from one pump to the other searching for fuel, while frantically calling loved ones, including those who are advanced in age and live alone, to check if their power situation was alright and whether they needed me to pick up fuel for them too. It was quite obvious to those who were still without power that night that there was a long way to go before the restoration of supply. With a prolonged power outage, there were very few functioning ATM machines in the city, so those without a supply of petty cash at home had a second round of shuttling to do, running from one ATM to another to see which one might be working. Prolonged power outages also led to the breakdown of telecom services, as one by one, the towers ran out of back-up supply and the inundated streets made it impossible to service them. So those who had to venture out, either to seek refuge in other people’s homes or to replenish food and fuel supplies, hugged their own family before leaving home because while they were out there would be no way of contacting them. I remember when I came home after one of these errands, the family anxiously came to the door and asked “was everything alright? How are the streets? Did you manage to get everything?” This is a glimpse of what it is like to live through a couple of days during a city-wide disaster. I’m not sure what possessed the minister that he forgot, so close to the midnight hour, that he was the power minister of the government and it was his job to oversee the power system in the entire country. I know he had his reasons for why he was unable to oversee restoration of supply but then, wouldn’t those he was taunting have their reasons for why the flooding was beyond their control? A few hours earlier he had tweeted this: “Have told KE management repeatedly that KE must make every effort in restoring power to the affected areas of Karachi. Govt of Sind should provide all out assistance in clearing the water logged areas so that power restoration can be expedited.” And then a minute later came this: “My name is Omar Ayub Khan. I am from Pakistan and I #SupportGaza”. And there it was, a tweet for the people of Karachi, and another for the people of Gaza. I wonder what he was doing in the two hours between his Gaza and Mohenjodaro tweets. If you’re wondering why I’m reserving my ire for the power minister when many others were attacking the Sindh government, the answer is that I do not expect it from ministers of the government in power to taunt their rivals and opposition members when tens of millions of people are living through an emergency in precisely the area of responsibility held by the minister. There is not much one can say about this mindset which leads people to hurl taunts, abuse and mockery at those who are beset by difficulties. At the time of writing, the valley of Swat is in the middle of terrible flooding as the Swat river has overflowed due to heavy rains in the valley. My prayers, and I expect the prayers and thoughts of all especially those who are in a position of power, should be with the people who are suffering in the midst of this developing disaster. But it is nearly futile to try and point out the basic rules of human decency anymore. The climate created by the ruling party is one where the most voluble abuse is considered to have won the day. Where one taunts others when they are in difficulty but demands decency when one is oneself in difficulty. Where there is one set of rules for those who refuse to give blind devotion to the party leader and another for those who do. Sadly, no newspaper would print my feelings when I saw the tweet recommending the Sindh government and its officers to visit Mohenjodaro and Harappa to study their drainage systems. But let me just ask the minister this question: should they take DHA and Cantonment Board Clifton officers with them when they make this trip?",negative
"A GROUP of women journalists have decided that enough is enough and have released a joint statement condemning the climate of abuse and threats that has been created on social media by accounts that are allegedly connected to people belonging to, or professing to be followers of, the PTI government. They were joined by the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists as well. Both groupings called on the government to take action against those who use social media to hurl threats, or circulate personally identifiable information of women journalists, or put into circulation doctored images designed to cause offence and attempt to humiliate them. This has become a very serious problem now, but the important thing for those using these tactics in an attempt to silence critical voices to know is that it is not only futile, but counterproductive. I have often wondered what goes through the mind of a young man (and yes, the overwhelming majority of those engaged in this sort of trolling are men) when he puts out an abusive message for a journalist. Consider this. A typical journalist, not even among the big names, can have an audience in the thousands, a medium size one will usually be communicating on a regular basis with tens of thousands, and on some big days, perhaps hundreds of thousands. The big-name TV anchors routinely communicate with an audience that is measured in the millions on a daily basis. Imagine yourself at an event speaking to a hall packed with around 30,000 people. Each of them can hear your words clearly and are paying attention. A few hundred are standing in a corner heckling you. Who will you reserve your attention for? The tens of thousands who are listening to you or the few hundreds who are heckling? The answer is obvious. Those who are apparently being encouraged to engage in abusive behaviour against the government’s critics are searching for new ways to escalate such conduct. So watching the behaviour of this misguided youth I often wonder what they think they are accomplishing by engaging in abuse. Do they think the other party will stop, reflect, and desist from being critical of those in power due to the abuse? Do they think others who see the abuse will change their minds about the contents of the journalists’ work as a result of the abuse? What exactly is the objective of using abuse as a standard language in which to engage with the work of others? Ultimately, it’s futile to use abuse as a weapon in social engagements. And once those who resort to this sort of behaviour begin to tire of the futility of their efforts, they up the ante and start hunting down personal details about their target and make those public, or doctor images to put their targets’ face on compromising photographs as a means of mockery. Some women journalists say photos of their faces have been photo-shopped onto pornographic images and put into circulation as a way of harassing and intimidating them. All those who have been critical of official circles have faced trolling of this sort, but women journalists are usually targeted with a particular ferocity. In their statement, the group of women journalists allege that their social media timelines are often “barraged with gender-based slurs, threats of sexual and physical violence”. They go on to say that such behaviour has “the potential to incite violence and lead to hate crimes, putting our physical safety at risk”. At the moment, I am not aware of many incidents where online attacks of this sort spilled over into the real world. But the large numbers of young men who are apparently being actively encouraged to engage in abusive and threatening behaviour against the critics of the government are growing increasingly frustrated, and searching for new ways to escalate their hateful conduct. If left to their own devices, it is inevitable that there will be an incident of a real-life attack by one of these random youth whose mind is too addled on the poisonous rhetoric of official circles. It is sad to note that this behaviour has been normalised from the very top. All of us vividly recall moments in the ruling party’s ascension to power, for instance, when a senior party member struck Daniyal Aziz of the PML-N during a live TV show. This same corps of young men not only loudly cheered on the act, but started referring to Daniyal as ‘Danielle’, suggesting it is a woman’s place to get slapped by a man. Remember the days of container politics in 2014? There was a virtually unending river of abuse that came down from the container top, and now that river even flows through parliament where childish and abusive tropes are commonly used by the treasury benches to caricature and abuse the opposition in parliament. What these young men on social media are doing is emulating the behaviour of those they perceive to be their heroes. Some social media outlets are now tweaking their rules to discourage this sort of behaviour. This is a welcome development, but it is not the answer. What is needed is for those at the top, starting with the prime minister himself and then all the way down, to loudly and visibly start discouraging this behaviour. After this, there needs to be outright condemnation of it. And then must come the penalties, the arrests and prosecution of those who use social media and other means of modern communication to threaten and abuse others in patently illegal ways. This behaviour is stunting the growth and development of those young men who have been encouraged to engage in it. A sizable section of our youth run the risk of growing up with these toxic attitudes. One shudders to imagine what sort of fathers and husbands they will be if these attitudes are allowed to harden.",negative
"THIS country has been through a repeated cycle of boom and bust that by now most of the playbook is well known to those who have followed these successive bursts with any care. Ultimately, they all look and feel the same, and most importantly, they all end in tears with appeals to the IMF for emergency bailouts. Those of us who have seen more than one such cycle unfold know another part of this story: it is hard to call them for what they truly are while they are unfolding. The indicators that we are accustomed to using to show economic problems will seem to be improving, growth will rise, jobs will be created, opportunities will multiply, people will make money, some business associations might even laud the government of the day, ministers and party leaders will laud the numbers to show that they have fixed what was broken, and tell us that the good times are now here to stay. It happens every time. Remember when Shaukat Aziz proudly announced “we have broken the begging bowl”, when his government refused to draw the last tranche from the IMF programme in 2004? His argument was that stability had been restored to the economy, reforms had unlocked its potential, and the nine per cent growth rate and “record high reserves” that had accumulated were now here to stay and Pakistan had finally cracked its addiction to foreign assistance. Of course it didn’t last, just like the naysayers of the day were warning, and by 2008 Pakistan was back on the doorstep of the IMF as reserves had depleted to critical levels, large-scale capital flight was underway, growth had crashed and the country was staring down the barrel of a large macroeconomic adjustment of precisely the sort that marked the beginning of Musharraf’s rule (from 1999 to 2001). The critical ingredient that was missing in the first two growth booms is similarly absent here: reform. The second boom period began in 2014 and had crashed by 2018. Perhaps we can say the government was forced into pro-cyclical spending to shore up their political fortunes once their political crisis began and those boom years could have had another year (or maybe even two) of life in them had they been allowed to continue without political challenge. But the crash was coming. There is no denying that. It is necessary to keep reminding people of this history of constant boom-bust cycles because it looks as if we are gearing up to repeat this story one more time, albeit in diminished form. With all the incentives that have been thrown at property developers and the real-estate sector, the beginnings of a ‘construction boom’ might get going now. One critical indicator to watch in this context is cement offtakes, that have shown a sharp rise in the months of June and July in the north zone (KP and Punjab), which can point to the beginnings of large-scale construction activity getting started. This has been made possible by massive inducements offered to property developers since at least April, the largest of which is a tax amnesty scheme that allows undeclared cash to be transferred to real-estate investments without any questions asked. Along with this there is a slew of tax incentives and subsidised credit that is part of the overall package with the idea to kick-start the process of growth in the country. Some might argue that this is necessary to emerge from the devastation of the lockdowns, but the fact is Imran Khan was talking about incentives for the construction sector as far back as November 2019, long before Covid-19, so it is an ingrained priority for the government that is only now beginning to be implemented. Alongside these incentives, the sharp reduction in interest rates has given many businesses an unexpected boost. Coupled with some subsidised credit schemes being operated by the State Bank, industry people say they are finding reason to smile after a protracted winter. The net result will start showing in the data soon, with construction producing a knock-on effect in allied industries, exports (which have already rebounded to pre-Covid levels) rising further, and the ‘green shoots’ giving a boost to government revenues and helping manage the growing fiscal deficit as well. The reason it is worth sounding a note of caution is that this government, perhaps more than any other, has the tendency to start declaring triumph with every turn in the data. The green shoots we are seeing now are surely a welcome sign after the darkness of the last two years since the macroeconomic adjustment began, but surely the resultant growth will be a smaller affair than the last two growth booms, unless this time too they can find a way to buttress the growth with massive infusions of money from outside (whether war on terror assistance in the case of Musharraf, or Chinese money in the case of Nawaz Sharif). But the critical ingredient that was missing in the first two growth booms is similarly absent here: reform. If a growth boom is indeed shaping up, due to massive inducements from the state coupled with an amnesty scheme, it will happen in the absence of any underlying productivity increases, any broadening of the tax base or composition of exports, any power sector reform or any improvement in the savings environment. This is precisely what has happened every time in the past when they induced a fake growth boom using massive government inducements, without anything else being changed. Admittedly, whatever might be shaping up today looks like it will be smaller than its predecessors, but the same lessons from the earlier era apply equally well. Short spurts of growth feel good while they happen, but in the absence of structural reform in the underlying economy, they always leave the economy depleted and the state on its knees. Let’s hope that history is not about to be repeated again.",negative
"SO now we have a new story regarding the ‘fake pilot licences’ saga. Since the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been inundated with queries from its counterparts around the world, as well as foreign airlines that employ Pakistani pilots, about the credentials it has been issuing — whether pilots licences or airworthiness certifications for aircraft — it has taken on a new line altogether. Oman’s civil aviation authority sent a letter on July 2 asking about certifications being issued by the CAA. In its reply, the CAA said: “It is important to clarify that all Pilot Licenses issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) are genuine and validly issued. None of the Pilot Licenses are fake, rather that matter has been misconstrued and incorrectly highlighted in the media/social media.” I would like to know what exactly this means. The aviation minister himself used the word ‘fake’ on three occasions at least, twice in English and once in Urdu, in his parliament address. Not only that, he also said that many of these pilots were inducted on political pressure, and had ‘fake licences’ made for them due to this political pressure. Everybody is welcome to look up that speech. This discussion about the ‘fake licences’ occurs shortly after the 35-minute mark, where he also adds that there has been an ongoing inquiry into pilots licences since February 2019, and that is where many of these ‘fake licences’ have been unearthed. Two days later, he held a press conference in which he repeated the allegation and gave a detailed justification for why it was necessary for him to make the disclosure about the pilots who have ‘fake licences’ (his words, not mine), saying sometimes chemotherapy is necessary to cure an illness. How is the CAA blaming the media for the fact that its counterparts around the world are demanding answers from it? So how is the CAA today blaming the media for the fact that its counterparts around the world are demanding answers from it regarding the credentials it issues? And has the minister approved this particular response sent to the Omani authorities? Because he is telling parliament, and the people directly, that the problems in Pakistan’s aviation sector are so far advanced that he has to undertake ‘chemotherapy’ to address them, while at the same time turning around to his counterparts around the world and saying “none of the pilots’ licences are fake” and the media has only “misconstrued and improperly highlighted” an issue. I recall a time when Prime Minister Imran Khan used to make the argument that a minister should take responsibility when a crash or an accident happens in the area entrusted to him or her. Remember the examples he cited from around the world to buttress his case? And one of the reasons he gave for why a minister must step down if a crash happens on his watch was that an impartial inquiry cannot possibly happen under the minister’s own watch. The minister in question will never allow those facts to surface which might implicate his own lack of leadership and competence. I think we have a living example of that happening before our eyes. In the two years of the PTI government, we have had a train accident that led to the death by incineration of more than 70 people back in October 2019. Does anybody know who has been held responsible for that? Did any minister step down? We have had a plane crash in which 98 people died, and all we have is the minister blaming the pilots before the country, while his people sheepishly tell their counterparts around the world that all is well, it’s all just media hype at home. It doesn’t end there. We have a minister who saw the circular debt double under Khan’s watch when he had angrily promised to bring it down to zero, and his only punishment was that he was transferred to petroleum instead, the portfolio that the aviation minister had just vacated. In petroleum, this same minister gave us first a petrol and diesel supply crisis, and now the beginnings of a fuel supply crisis for the power sector. Good thing the hydel turbines kicked in to save him there, because the entire country could have been going through the kind of load-shedding that the city of Karachi is seeing on account of fuel supply issues. In his first address to the nation upon coming to office, Khan told us that his vision for reforming Pakistan begins with the FBR. A “country where only eight lakh people out of 20 crore pay their taxes will not be able to function for very long,” he said. Then he lamented how rich people don’t pay taxes in this country. “I promise you today,” he said, “first thing I want to fix is the FBR.” This is consistent with the vision outlined in the PTI, whose chapter on economic growth also begins with the FBR. It promises “a robust tax policy, efficient tax administration structure and effective enforcement mechanism”. To do this, it promised to increase the FBR’s autonomy, and “reducing the influence of ministry of finance”. That was then. Two years later, we have seen four different FBR chairs, meaning an average tenure of three months each. And today, we are at a point where not only is there no plan for reforming the FBR, there is no tax plan to meet the current year’s revenue target. At least none that anybody has seen, because the finance ministry is still busy negotiating that with the IMF. So much for “I will start with the FBR.” So much for “reducing the influence of the ministry of finance”. Today, the sad fact is that the government can’t even hold its own ministers accountable, let alone bring accountability to the rest of the country. By the prime minister’s own words — ‘I will start with the FBR’ — all we can conclude is that two years down the road, the PTI government has not even begun yet.",negative
"LET’S get one thing straight. The collapse of PIA did not happen overnight. The minister’s public proclamation that 262 out of 800 pilots certified by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of Pakistan are carrying “fake” or “suspect” licences was an important trigger for the ban on PIA flights landing in European airports. The larger cause was the failure to meet successive safety management standards. PIA had lost its safety certification given by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) back in March 2012 after repeated incidents of minor accidents (like a tyre catching fire during landing) or sheer carelessness on the part of the flight or ground crew. But what the aviation minister did on June 24 was tantamount to taking a sledgehammer to an already fragile situation. First he announced on the floor of parliament that up to one-third of Pakistani pilots possess fake licences, and then followed this up by releasing a list with their names. In the communication sent to the PIA CEO (who had been demanding a list since the announcement was made), he did not say that the pilots in question have “fake licences”. Instead, he said that an inquiry has “indicated grounds to suspect the genuineness of several pilot licences”. It turns out that the minister does not have evidence that the pilot licences in question are fake. The language of the letter is significantly watered down compared to the bombast with which the announcement in parliament was made. What are these indications? What are the grounds to suspect the genuineness of the licences in question? All this has yet to be established. The letter sent to the PIA CEO did not say that these pilots have fake licences and should be turfed out. It said only that the pilots mentioned in the attached list should be grounded while formal proceedings under the relevant Civil Aviation Rules 1994 should be carried out. During these proceedings, the letter continued, “appropriate opportunity … shall be provided by Civil Aviation Authority to each individual pilot to clarify his/her position”. Now take a deep breath and pause. It turns out that the minister does not have evidence that the pilot licences in question are fake. All he has are indications that give grounds to suspect this. Based on these indications, he can proceed under the established rules to determine case by case whether the suspicions are indeed borne out or not. And each pilot in question has to be given a chance to clear his or her position. So an obvious question arises: would it not have been a better idea to wait for these proceedings to end, for the compliance report to be filed, and for final determinations to emerge in each case before going public in such a way? What was the rush to announce this matter so publicly that it couldn’t wait till the proceedings were finished? After all, the pilots in question would still be grounded till proceedings concluded, posing no risk to the safety of passengers. What does the minister owe to those pilots who are successful in clearing their names during the proceedings? In all, he says the credentials of 28 pilots have been “confirmed fake”, of which some confessed. For the rest he says proceedings are still underway. He was at pains in his June 26 press conference to emphasise that the rest are just “suspected cases.” In total, the Personnel Licensing Office of the CAA issues 22 different kinds of certifications and licenses. They relate to pilots, from gliders and ultralights and balloons to private and commercial pilots, both aeroplanes as well as helicopters. Then there are certifications for instrument rating, flight engineers, cabin crew competency, air traffic controllers, flight operations officers and technicians. Then there are ratings and endorsements and validation certificates. In fact, the entire aviation sector of Pakistan stands on the CAA and its credibility. And now, with his words, the minister has smeared that credibility so badly there is no telling how long it will take to recover. Consider for example, that EASA, in its letter announcing the suspension of PIA flights from European airports, pointed specifically to the minister’s statement of June 24 as the reason for the suspension of flight operations. The other issues, primarily the failure to implement “all elements of a Safety Management System” all required months in which to be addressed, as per the timelines given in EASA’s own letter. None of this is rocket science, nor can it be said that there are deep-rooted counter currents preventing the implementation of these steps, like there were in the case of implementing the action plan given to the Financial Action Task Force. Implementing a safety system of the sort called for by EASA is where the ministers’ energies were actually needed, rather than getting into an ego clash with the pilots union. The EASA letter also makes clear that blaming the crash of flight 8303 entirely on pilot error is wrong. Instead, it points to “successive breaches of multiple layers of safety defences in the safety management system” as the reason. The letter further states that based on the minister’s own statement regarding “fake licences”, that “Pakistan, as the state of operator, is currently not capable to certify and oversee its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards”. The minister’s words, which were clearly fired in haste and before even all the facts were in, have clearly tarnished the entire country’s credibility to maintain and operate an aviation sector. Their impact has not fallen only on the pilots named in the list. From here on, it is not just PIA that has to prove that it has pilots and aircraft that are airworthy and adhere to internationally accepted safety standards. It is the entire CAA that has to prove that it has the capability required to issue a wide range of licenses and certificates, that its airports and air traffic control systems are up to international standards, and much more. I sincerely hope whatever the minister was trying to achieve was worth all this, though I seriously doubt it.",negative
"ONCE again we are discovering the hard way how fragile our oil supply chain really is. Across Punjab and KP at least, on-and-off shortages of vital fuels like petrol and diesel keep breaking out at the pumps, and industry executives are saying this situation is likely to persist till July. In the meantime, they are urging critical price reforms that the government has finally lent a serious ear to. Also read: Officials begin to take notice as petrol shortage worsens Here is what’s going on. The petrol (and wherever I say this I mean to include diesel as well) supply chain in the country runs primarily on imported product. The price at which the fuels will be sold is totally regulated by the government, end to end, except for hi-octane fuel which is used primarily in high-end imported cars. That fuel is deregulated, meaning the companies are free to set whatever price they want for it. The government decides how much the fuel will sell for at the pump, as well as how much the refineries will sell it for to local companies. For its part, the government has to get involved in the pricing of fuel because there are very few players in the market. Less than a dozen OMCs and less than half a dozen refineries operate in Pakistan. Left to their own devices, these companies can (and most likely will) easily collude with each other to set prices and fleece consumers, so the sector cries out for deep government involvement until such time as the regulatory authorities can be trusted to prevent collusive behaviour. The flip side of this intervention is that having taken on the responsibility to set prices, conduct regular ‘product review meetings’ (held periodically between government and industry to ascertain the supply and demand position of all vital fuels in the country), the government also picks up the responsibility to ensure the smooth supply of product in the market. A number of things have gone wrong this time. But at the heart of them is an attempt by the government to impose an unrealistic price at a critical time. But in ensuring that the supply chain continues to function smoothly, the government has to perform a little bit of a high-wire act. It has to dictate the terms under which the oil industry will operate, but in doing so, it has to balance out the public interest with the vested interest of the oil companies. The oil companies want high profits, consumers want cheap fuel, the government wants its taxes, and we all want the pipeline to keep flowing. Keeping this enterprise running is not rocket science, but it does require some brains. Erring on one side or the other can cause the smooth supply of product to break down, which serves nobody’s interest, or the price to rise too far that burdens consumers and fuels inflation. A number of things have gone wrong this time. But at the heart of them is an attempt by the government to impose an unrealistic price at a critical time when international prices were climbing. April saw some of the greatest volatility in oil markets, as prices tumbled amid lockdowns and domestic demand all but dried up. Arranging new shipments amid this uncertainty was a tricky job. On May 20, for example, one of the largest OMCs in the country wrote a letter to the government warning them that June will see fuel shortages. “Given the volatility in the prices of Crude Oil and Products as well as in freight” the letter read, “it seems that we will have a severe shortage of Motor Gasoline in June, which will add to the current situation in Diesel, for the following reasons….” The reasons given were simple: as per the prevailing price formula, both refineries and OMCs will incur steep losses for sales in June, and the cargoes planned by PSO will be unable to meet the June demand. Whose job was it to receive, listen to, and act upon this warning? One would think it would be the energy minister. Mr Omar Ayub has a track record of dropping the ball in such important matters. A year before this letter, back in May of 2019 for example, he was waving his fist and talking tough at what he called “mafias” in the power sector that were colluding in power losses, and that he vowed to bring down. He also vowed to reduce the circular debt to zero by December 2020, and repeated the vow to the prime minister as well. He boasted how 30,000 FIRs had been registered in his muscular recovery drive and 4,000 arrests had been made. The circular debt was close to Rs450 billion at the time. Today, the circular debt is touching Rs2 trillion, meaning it has quadrupled, and the government is introducing special legislation in parliament to allow them to tack on additional surcharges to consumers’ bills to recover the money that Mr Ayub vowed with his fist he would recover from the “thieves and the defaulters” last year. In a nutshell, he failed and we have to pay for it. So what does the government do? They move him over to the petroleum side instead, where he has now given us a fuel shortage, and is once again waving his fist in the air and blaming the “oil mafia” for the situation and is getting FIRs registered against oil company executives, the very people the government needs to work with in order to get the supply chain moving again. The net result is that once again he has had to be moved out of the way. He may be the minister, but the negotiations with the industry are being conducted by three special assistants of the prime minister instead. They are discussing pricing reform, and chances are pretty high the net outcome will be the same as the proposals made in the letter of May 20. Eventually, the bluster will give way to pragmatism. The FIRs will be emptied out, the sound and fury will wither away, and Mr Omar Ayub will be left on his perch, in search of a new mission for himself.",negative
"I WONDER if the leaders of this country, along with their proxies and mouthpieces, realise how ridiculous they look baying for the blood of their political opponents at a time when a pandemic envelops the land, a giant swarm of locusts is devouring its crops and a massive crisis in the availability of vehicular fuel is knocking at the door. These are challenges of staggering proportions, and their full impact is coming our way in the months ahead. Let’s clarify one thing first. The economy of Pakistan is indeed infested with rent-seeking behavior — defined as profit-maximising behaviour that pursues its reward by rigging the rules of the game in favour of a small number of players. And not just the sectors under ‘investigation’ by the current regime (sugar, power, wheat and oil refining and marketing). The same is true in cement, textiles, fertiliser, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and financial services among many others. Wherever there is large-scale industry in this country, it survives on government contracts, pricing and tax regimes, subsidies or other handouts. There may be exceptions, but they are few. Managing this rent-seeking behaviour is not rocket science, but it takes a little skill, a little knowledge about how the markets are structured, a little familiarity with the people who run things and how they build their arguments and present their case, along with some ability to do basic maths. Failure to manage these rent seekers means they will create artificial shortages, manipulate prices, evade taxes and trick the government into passing rules that favour the rentiers and their rents. If one gets too coercive with them, they can simply halt the supply of whatever material they are responsible for, as might be happening in the oil-marketing sector today. Remember the ‘petrol crisis; of January 2015? That’s what happens when the supply chain breaks. Remember the rampant load-shedding of 2013? That’s what happens when power-sector finances and the fuel supply chain is not kept moving. Each of these requires skilful management by the government. The truth is that every rent seeker in the country has taken this government for a ride. If any government wants to change the system to reduce the rents, it will take a little skill to engineer the right reforms. That’s what happened with the pharmaceutical sector after 2011, when after the drug-pricing crisis, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan was formed as an autonomous body, and hung like an albatross around the pharmaceutical companies’ neck for years as they sought price increases. So if you are a little confused with all the inquiries and investigations that have been raining down upon us with growing ferocity for a few months — from the sugar inquiry report to wheat and the independent power producers (IPP), and now the oil-marketing companies who are at the receiving end of this ire — let me make it simple for you. Here is what is going on. Whatever these guys don’t get, or cannot control, they call a ‘mafia’ and get all coercive over the industry players. When the IPP report came out back in April, for example, the president of the country said it was evidence that “the country has been gang raped by a mafia”. The word was used repeatedly by others as well, until suddenly they stopped and you don’t hear much about the IPP report anymore. The hostile fist-waving ended almost as if on cue, and that age-old mechanism for ending things with an amicable whimper was deployed: they formed a ‘committee’. Word among the IPP investors is that one phone call from the Chinese ambassador did the trick. The wheat inquiry was also gently set aside, perhaps because its findings were not what they were anticipating. They thought the inquiry committee would come back and tell them who all is responsible for hoarding wheat. Instead, it came back and told them that government departments across the board, from Passco to the provincial governments, failed to carry out proper procurement. No fun in pursuing that. On Monday, the petroleum minister stood in parliament and blamed the ongoing fuel shortages on a ‘mafia’. Watching, I could think of only one question I’d like to ask him: ‘what do you want to be when you grow up?’ The fact that these shortages exist is first and foremost to be blamed on the minister himself, and if he cannot manage the giant companies in his sector, there is no point labelling them all a ‘mafia’. The truth is that every rent seeker in the country has taken this government for a ride. We saw a drug price spiral early in its term that they have not been able to reverse (nor will they be able to). We saw public money lavished on the textile sector, whether as subsidised fuel or credit, and the only thing they have to show for it after one and a half years is “volumetric increase in exports”. Somebody please explain to them that exports are not measured in kilogrammes. We saw amnesty schemes for property developers. And along the way we saw price spirals from medicines to food. Even as the information minister with the ‘asset recovery czar’ seated next to him were unveiling their elaborate “penal action plan” for the sugar industry last Sunday, the character who played a starring role in the inquiry report — Jahangir Khan Tareen — was most likely entering UK airspace, safely out of their reach. The “penal action plan” they announced that day cast its net so widely, and seeks to investigate so much that it doesn’t look much like a plan anymore. The true believers are holding their breath, in desperate anticipation that the transformative moment they have been waiting for since Khan came to power may finally have arrived. The sugar barons are taking some Panadol. ‘Another government, another headache’, they’re telling themselves. The rest of us are reaching for the popcorn. Meanwhile, disease stalks the land and locusts devour the crops and people scuffle for fuel at the pumps. This has to be the grimmest comedy I’ve ever seen.",negative
"I HAVE not seen a government abdicate all responsibility to safeguard its citizens from clear and present danger so comprehensively as this government has just done. It was a moment of disbelief watching the prime minister announce that people should take care, try to stay indoors — and then announce a reopening of tourism so people in large numbers start going to areas like Murree, Swat, Kaghan and Naran and the northern areas, where healthcare facilities are already in very short supply. Expecting that these tourists will ‘observe SOPs’ or otherwise not be carrying the virus with them is a weak and distant hope. More likely, this step will open the floodgates of the Covid-19 infection for areas that are already too ill-equipped to handle the situation. Those who keep invoking the plight of the poor and the daily wagers to make the point that this is a fight the country cannot afford are missing the point entirely. This was a moment to bring far-reaching changes in the country, to turn the focus of the government away from rentier elites and the security establishment and towards the people. This was the perfect opportunity to start crafting the architecture of what Imran Khan envisioned. In fact, campaigned on: to build a welfare state. ‘We gave you the SOPs, we told you to be careful’ they will say as they blame the people. The elements with which to build this state are there, as are the resources. What is lacking is the will. This moment presented the perfect opportunity to forge that will, because for a while, back in mid-March, everybody was on the same page ie the fight against the virus was the top priority. The means with which to deliver social protection, for example, are there. As are the resources with which to ramp up the capacity of the country’s healthcare system. Contact tracing, widespread testing and all other elements with which the fight against the virus could be waged are all possible to undertake, given the will. Take one example. One of the fastest-growing segments in Pakistan’s payments system is mobile phone banking. There are currently 27 providers for this service (I’m talking about mobile phone banking provided by the banks, not by the telecoms, which is a different story). Consider the numbers. In the first quarter of FY2017, there were 1.2 million transactions through this channel, totalling Rs21 billion. Two years later — quarter two of FY2019 — that figure rose to 8.5m and Rs159.9bn as the total amount transacted through this channel. In the quarter two of FY2020, these figures have now risen to 17.8m transactions and Rs382.5bn transacted in total. The numbers are more than doubling every year, faster than any other channel in our payments system, whether ATM or point of sale or internet banking or any other. If you include mobile banking services provided by the telecom companies, these figures skyrocket. The number of merchants servicing clients for these channels is also growing rapidly. It is disingenuous when those who know better argue that we cannot reach the poor because they do not have bank accounts, to take one example. Everybody who uses a mobile phone has a bank account because all mobile numbers now come with a mobile bank account attached with them. If the will to use these channels, coupled with all the ways in which databases of the poor can be built, was present, there were any number of ways in which a vast social protection scheme could be built. Instead, what we had was what the prime minister disingenuously called a ‘construction package’. The reason I say it was disingenuous is because it was, in fact, never a ‘construction package’. Study its details and you will realise it was not designed to restart work at construction sites. It was designed to restart the buying and selling of plot files and flats. In short, it was designed to restart speculation in the property market, and that’s not surprising given who all were providing input in crafting the package. Latest figures released by the cement industry show that there was a 37 per cent plunge in cement sales in the country in the month of May. The construction package was announced in early April, and the prime minister said work should begin by April 14. There is no way to tell if any work has indeed begun in the buying and selling of plot files because this is a totally undocumented area and the package contained an amnesty scheme to plough black money — whether illicit or just tax-evaded — to acquire assets in the property market without any questions being asked as to the source. With these kinds of reflexes, to turn to the billionaires and speculator elite for advice in the middle of a public health emergency, it is not surprising that the government has been directed towards laying down its arms in this critical fight with the argument that ‘the cure is worse than the disease’. What is grievous and downright pathetic to note is that this surrender has been done in the name of the poor, whereas it is actually at the behest of the rich, who do not want to see their businesses closed any longer. So if you’re poor in Naya Pakistan, and you want to feed your family, you have no choice but to go and face the infection and consider it one more occupational hazard. They have built their SOPs and thrown the gates open, and now that the infection is spreading like wildfire, it is the people themselves who will be blamed. ‘We gave you the SOPs, we told you to be careful’ they will say down the road. Perhaps it was a futile hope to harbour in the first place, that the rulers of this country will rise to a challenge, seize the opportunity, and undertake a far-reaching renegotiation of the compact between the ruler and the ruled. Instead, they decided to listen to traders and speculators, and throw the country to the mercy of the virus.",negative
"KARACHI: A cluster of coal-fired power plants in the Thar desert, some of which are already operational, could expose around 100,000 people to harmful acidic gases exceeding safe limits established by the World Health Organization and 29,000 people could die from air pollution related causes over the 30-year operating life of the plants, a new study by an independent research organization shows. The study was released in an online presentation on Friday by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), which describes itself as “an independent research organisation focused on revealing the trends, causes and health impacts, as well as the solutions to air pollution.” The lead author is Lauri Myllyvirta, whose bio on the CREA’s website says he has “served as a member of the Technical Working Group on regulating emissions from large combustion plants in the EU and currently serves as a member of the expert panel on regulating SO2 [sulphur dioxide] emissions in South Africa.” The report is titled: “Air quality, health and toxics impacts of the proposed coal mining and power cluster in Thar, Pakistan.” More than 6,000MW worth of coal-fired power plants are in various stages of development in the country, authors say, of which 3,700MW is to be situated in the Thar desert. One plant of 660MW capacity has already been commissioned there. “The proposed plants would constitute one of the largest air pollutant, mercury and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission hotspots in South Asia” the report says. Aside from exposing 100,000 people to dangerously high levels of SO2 and 29,000 to air pollution related fatalities, the power plants complex will also lead to a sprawling array of health related complications. “Other health impacts include 40,000 asthma emergency room visits, 19,900 new cases of asthma in children, 32,000 preterm births, 20 million days of work absence (sick leave) and 57,000 years lived with disability related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes and stroke” the report says. In addition to this, the power plants will release 1,400kg of mercury per year, “of which one fifth would be deposited on land ecosystems in the region”, the report says. Most of this deposition will be on crop land and increase mercury concentration in the food chain. Eight coal-based power plants have been commissioned in Pakistan over the last three years, and one small plant has been operational since 1995. Taken together, the nameplate power generating capacity of these plants is 5,090MW, and another eleven plants with a total generating capacity of 6,208MW are still in the pipeline. Authors also point out that Sindh province, where the bulk of coal-fired capacity is set to be established, already has a poor record of taking air quality seriously. The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, for example, does not provide ambient air quality reports routinely and in a transparent manner. Not only that, its Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) are much more relaxed than for the rest of the country or the WHO recommendations. “[W]hile the NEQS sets the PM2.5 limit for 24-hour mean at 35 µg/m3, the SEQS sets it at 75 µg/m3” the report says. The authors also found serious gaps in how the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)for these plants were done. “Did anyone even read these EIAs during their approval?” the author asked during his presentation. “The existence of such elementary errors and omissions in the cornerstone data used in the EIAs makes it appear that the reports have not been independently reviewed by the regulator, raising serious questions about the level of regulatory oversight,” the authors say after reviewing all the gaps in the emissions data of the EIAs.",negative
"SO apparently 2.2 per cent of the population dying from a highly contagious disease is an acceptable risk to take, but a 1.5pc contraction in total economic output is not. That is what the underlying message is behind the government’s decision to order a lifting of the strict social-distancing announced by the provincial governments around March 23. Monday was the first working day after the new, far-reaching exemptions to the lockdowns were announced on Saturday, and what we saw were grievous sights of packed bazaars in virtually every city around the country. A feast for the virus, which one doctor from the frontlines desperately tried to warn people is dangerous — “it literally devours your lungs” he tweeted. The current case fatality rate in Pakistan is 2.2pc, if you do straight arithmetic on the number of cases against the number of deaths. The finance ministry and the IMF have both said they expect the economy to contract by 1.5pc in the current fiscal year, where it had been growing by just under 3pc in the first three quarters of the fiscal year that ran from July to March. This means the impact of the lockdowns, which were expected to run from April to June when this estimate was drawn up, would not only negate whatever meagre growth there was in the economy, but actively turn the needle back into negative territory. It is not the interests of the poor that animate this government but those of the rich. But is this reason enough to throw caution to the winds and reopen the economy? If you’re looking at the money, then yes but if you’re looking at the lives then no. What exactly was the government looking at when they made this decision over the weekend? After all, their own data, and their own statements in that press talk where the announcement of the far-reaching exemptions was made, showed that the graph of the infections was still trending upward, sharply, and fatalities were continuing to rise. For an answer on where the government is getting its guidance from in these times, recall that memorable photograph of Prime Minister Imran Khan accepting a donation cheque from Faisal Edhi. Take a closer look at the two other people in the room at the time, shown in the picture. One is a massive property developer in Lahore, and also a textile giant with massive interests in the spinning sector and one time served as chairman of the powerful All Pakistan Textile Millowners Association (APTMA), and the other is a scion of one of the country’s largest industrial families with massive textile interests in Faisalabad and Lahore. Now listen to how Faisal Edhi himself describes the encounter in one of his television appearances after the picture came out. He says he entered, waited for six or seven minutes while the prime minister talked to the two industrialists in the room, then while leaving one of the two gentlemen told him “this is Faisal Edhi, Abdus Sattar Edhi sahib’s son” and then the prime minister stopped, and for half a minute, says Faisal in his interview, he got a chance to speak briefly with him in the door as he was leaving. Now consider this. If somebody was genuinely concerned with how the poor and the daily wagers are faring through the lockdowns, there are not many people in the country better able to tell you than Faisal Edhi. After all, he and his organisation deal with them on a daily basis, including for death rituals and healthcare provision. Anybody with even a remote concern for the poor, should they find themselves face to face with Faisal Edhi, would pepper him with at least a few questions. How are they faring? How many dead bodies are you receiving? How much do they understand the risks presented by the virus? What are good ways to target assistance to them? What can I do to help? There was none of that. The prime minister took the cheque (prompting some to wonder why the prime minister of a country should be taking donations from a charity that itself runs on donations), lent a perfunctory ear to some logistical problems faced by the charity organisation whose money he was accepting for his own corona relief fund, and left. The Rs10 million donation to the relief fund was the price of the entry ticket for Faisal Edhi. The only reason I’m using this example is because many people are familiar with it. Otherwise, it is not difficult to see that it is not the interests of the poor that animate this government, but those of the rich. By the time the meeting took place, around Rs45 billion had been released to the ‘export sectors’ under the prime minister’s Covid-19 package for exporters. In the previous three quarters, another Rs47bn was released for them under the Export Enhancement Package. A few days earlier, the cabinet had approved an amnesty scheme for property developers, disguised as a ‘construction package’, which the prime minister claimed was to help provide jobs for the poor affected by the lockdown, but in reality he had announced on Nov 11, 2019, that “construction is the government’s top priority” and this package had been in the works since then. There is nothing unusual here. It is a deeply Pakistani trait for the country’s leadership to serve the poor with their words and the rich with their deeds. There is a long pedigree to this peculiar brand of two-facedness, of doling out goodies to the rich in the name of the poor. This time, however, this gambit is being used to play with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The government has done an especially poor job of public messaging to awaken the populace to the dangers of the virus, how it transmits itself, what behaviours should be avoided and how social-distancing should be maintained. The result is people don’t take the danger very seriously. And now they lift the restrictions, in the name of the poor. God help us all.",negative
"A STUDY has been doing the rounds since early April which argues that in poor countries the price of a lockdown is larger than the benefits to be gained from it. The lead author of the paper is an economist of Bangladeshi extraction at Yale, who has plenty of experience working in developing countries and is no stranger to the lay of the land here. I first came across the study when it was being circulated in mid-April by people from industry, particularly those who were busy lobbying the government for easing the lockdown restrictions. It was subsequently cited in a few opinion pieces published in newspapers, and most recently was invoked by Planning Minister Asad Umar in his televised talk with the press in which he presented a bevy of arguments in support of easing the lockdown. It is useful to examine this study carefully, because doing so gives us an idea of how (some) economists approach questions of pressing and urgent public importance, and the limitations of the tools that they use. Economists have a hard time speaking plain English, especially when they attach dollar values to human lives. The study in question is called The Benefits and Costs of Social Distancing in Rich and Poor Countries, and it is authored by Zachary Barnett-Howell and Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, both highly credentialled and published economists at Yale. It begins by asking whether “shuttering the economy for weeks or months and mass unemployment are reasonable costs to pay?” in return for “flattening the curve” of Covid-19 cases. In order to answer their own question, the authors have to first render both the costs and benefits of a lockdown into a comparable unit. The economic costs are measured in dollars, whereas the health benefits of a lockdown are measured in lives saved. So the question arises: how to compare these two quantities — lives and money — with each other? To do so, the authors deploy a widely used model in the economics literature called the Value of Statistical Life model. What VSL does, quite literally, is tell us the dollar value of human life in different contexts. It was used originally in more limited contexts to help policymakers with complex judgements in cases where a particular policy imposed an economic cost in return for a vague health benefit. One example might be setting air quality standards. But with the passage of time, the VSL model began to be used in contexts far more complicated and more pressing than any in the past. One example is climate change, where a number of economists from prestigious universities have used the model to argue that the benefits from the mitigation efforts to curb carbon emissions that scientists are calling for are not worth the economic costs that they will impose. Simply put, they argued that the likelihood of climate change turning out to be a catastrophic event was small, and making massive investments in foregone output today to avert an event that was probabilistically miniscule was not worth the cost. The VSL at stake did not justify the massive investments required to curb greenhouse gas emissions to a two per cent increase by century end. This debate was sparked in 2006 when the Stern Review, put out by the eminent UK economist and public servant Nicholas Stern, argued that such an investment was now a matter of existential importance for mankind to make. Those who opposed him either took issue with his projections of the economic losses that climate change would impose, or invoked the VSL model to argue that the foregone economic output was larger than what was purportedly being saved. It took 16-year-old Greta Thunberg to cut through the Gordian technicalities into which the ensuing conversation fell. “People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing,” she exclaimed in her famous address to the UN in September 2019. “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” Today, the economists are back, armed with their VSL model, telling us that the dollar value of the lives saved as a result of the lockdown are worth less than the foregone output in developing countries, and they specifically mention Pakistan as one example. For the US, for example, they say 1.76 million lives will be saved through aggressive interventions, and put the total value of these lives at $7.9 trillion. This easily justifies a $2tr stimulus along with whatever economic losses result from a closure of the economy. It is worth asking, they argue, “whether similar mitigation and suppression strategies are equally valuable in low- and middle-income countries”. When they compute the VSL for countries like Pakistan and Nigeria, they find that the amount is so low that it makes little difference to have a suppression strategy. “In comparison to US losses, the dollar costs of uncontrolled Covid-19 in large countries such as Pakistan or Nigeria look miniscule.” So they’re basically telling us that we are investing precious foregone economic output to save lives that are not worth saving. Among the reasons why the Covid-19 loss is lower for a country like Pakistan is the “higher base VSL” in the US. They don’t give the dollar figure, but in a graphic they show that the “total VSL lost” for the US ranges from $25tr to just under $1tr depending on the severity of the suppression measures. For Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria, their model shows the total VSL lost to be near zero across the range. Economists have a hard time speaking plain English, especially when they are attaching dollar values to human lives. It is worth asking this pair to explain in plain English how the base VSL is higher in the US. And the irony is that this argument is being used to justify an easing of the lockdown in the name of the daily wagers themselves, the very people whose lives are found to be not worth saving!",negative
"UNMARRIED men and women may live together, alcohol restrictions are gone, and honour killings will be judged a crime just as any other. This official decree took effect last week in the United Arab Emirates, a country whose social-political matters are declaredly driven by Sharia law. These new rules apply equally to expatriates (88 per cent) and UAE citizens (12pc), the latter being mostly Sunni Muslims. Morality has apparently been ripped to shreds. In a frankly patriarchal desert culture where local women wear the niqab, what was unthinkable has happened. Still, no internal protest has been reported and neighbouring countries don’t care. Other GCC countries — and even normally hostile Turkey — have not commented. Saudi Arabia, once a bastion of Sunni conservatism, is following a similar path. Theocratic Iran semi-officially admits its alcohol problem and seems resigned. Billboards in Tehran warn against drinking and driving. No Arab Spring movement is driving this cultural liberalisation nor is popular democracy on the cards. Unless something happens, dynastic rulers and clerics will continue to rule. Various new top-down changes simply aim at making Arab countries more Western tourist and business friendly. The recent opening up to Israel undoubtedly plays some part. Pakistan seeks to lead the Muslim world but civil society in the Middle East is evolving much faster. But the new legislative changes freeing cultural behaviour are likely to impact society far more than political changes. They bring with them many key questions: what is sinful and improper and what does Islam forbid or permit? Which values are truly permanent and absolute and which must inevitably change with time? Notions of right and wrong are being turned upside down everywhere. There is, for example, complete acceptance now of television across the Muslim world. Even in Pakistan — among the most conservative Islamic countries — families spend evenings glued to the drawing room TV set. Men with beards and women from Al Huda casually snap selfies and WhatsApp them around. Yet older citizens cannot forget admonitions that Islam prohibits photography and the strident denunciations of TV as a ‘shaitani ala’ (devil’s tool). Aniconism, or a prohibition of depicting images of all living beings, was considered immutable and absolute by almost all early Islamic religious authorities. Scholars and clerics took as axiomatic that the creation and depiction of living forms is God’s prerogative, not to be trespassed upon by artists and painters. So, although Muslims can rightfully boast of magnificent Islamic architecture such as Taj Mahal and Dome of the Rock, Islamic art was narrowly restricted to decorative figural designs. Aniconism was taken so seriously that — although he later relented — a thoroughly liberal and scientific-minded man like Sir Syed Ahmad Khan refused to be photographed. The Afghan Taliban founder, Mullah Omar, never relented and so no known photo of him exists. The 2005 earthquake in Pakistan’s northern areas was widely attributed to watching television and, two days later, local clerics organised a mass smashing of TV sets in the town of Kaghan. The march of technology, however, made clerics realise they were missing a huge opportunity. Thus began the age of religious TV channels. Although limited initially to audio recitations and images of floating clouds and heavens, talking heads followed. Thereafter televised sermons and religious gatherings became popular and today’s clerical screen personalities have millions of devotees. Asked about earlier restrictions, one such megastar replied in a complicated way that Islam prohibits drawings and photos but not videos. Such adaptive changes are not unique to Islam or Pakistan. Fundamental transformations of thought and action have happened everywhere. Take slavery. From the 15th century onwards, European colonialists stole manpower for developing Europe by depopulating Africa. But slavery began phasing out after the European Enlightenment. The British Empire formally outlawed it in 1833. For the United States to follow suit took a civil war and an additional 32 years. Banning slavery from Muslim countries took much longer. Since the Quran discourages but does not forbid slavery, for nearly 13 centuries the possession of slaves was not condemned as sinful or illegal by any religious authority. In 1909, anti-slavery Young Turks, inspired by the Westernised Kemal Ataturk, forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to free his personal slaves. Ataturk dismissed the last Ottoman caliph in 1924 and so ended slavery. Turkey formally ratified the 1926 League of Nations convention abolishing slavery in 1933. Though Western driven, it was surely a good thing. Whether good or bad, the changes in the UAE’s laws are also Western driven. How the country’s authorities will explain them to the world and their people remains to be seen. Quite possibly no explanation will be forthcoming since UAE is a sovereign country where ruling dynasties exercise total control. Its people don’t have a voice. On the other hand, UAE could try to get endorsements for the new dispensation from pliant muftis and shaikh-ul-Islam. This won’t be the first time. Muslim rulers are thoroughly familiar with using friendly clerics for blessing bank interest disguised to avoid its condemnation as riba. UAE has supported various militant Salafist groups overseas and is said to have considerable control over the authorities of Egypt’s Jamia al-Azhar. This wide outreach could be useful for suppressing possible criticism. UAE’s rulers could also try a more straightforward explanation. The West thrives and prospers in spite of its evolving values — what was immoral yesterday is now simply the new normal. Until the 1960s, cohabitation was fiercely frowned upon in much of Europe and the US. But religious opposition has since softened and, in fact, most religions are following the trend. UAE’s rulers might try arguing that Islam, suitably interpreted, can do so as well. As with child marriage, widow remarriage and polygamy, cohabitation will doubtless lead to furious disputes. But, like it or not, the arrow of time is unidirectional and irreversible. Pakistan could learn much from recent cultural developments and liberalisation of social values in the rest of the Muslim world — a world which it had once aspired to lead. But now in a state of confusion, and dragged willy-nilly by global forces towards an uncertain future, it prefers to keep its eyes fixed firmly upon the past while praying for old times to return.",negative
"WHEN our prime minister lectures Europe about Islamophobia, the world snickers. Forced conversions? Lynching by enraged mobs? Having to curse another religion’s founder prior to applying for a Pakistani passport? Discrimination is built into our laws: Pakistan’s Constitution explicitly excludes non-Muslims from full citizenship. For multiple reasons every human rights listing puts Pakistan close to the bottom. Very recently a group of abuse-yelling young men in Gujranwala chose to video-record themselves while spraying black paint onto a poster of Prof Abdus Salam. An Ahmadi and Pakistan’s sole science Nobel Prize winner who died 25 years ago, Salam is the only Pakistani who has seriously impacted the world of science. That the posted video went viral with tens of thousands of views — and that it received high approval — speaks of raw mediaeval hatreds boiling over from time to time with or without an excuse. The video is that of ordinary people — at least those in Punjab — and was not officially ordered. But what of governments? Do national leaders acknowledge that scientific merit must be disentangled from matters of faith? And how has the military establishment seen things? These questions are important not just because of some particular individual but because government, industry and academia function properly only if there are layered meritocracies built upon recognition of individual ability and competence. Salam’s case is a litmus test. The world rightly ignores complaints of Islamophobia from a country that mistreats its religious minorities. Gen Ayub Khan could not have cared less about Salam being an Ahmadi and appointed him as scientific adviser; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto thought similarly even as he surrendered his principles for political gain in 1974; Ziaul Haq was ideologically charged and very wary of Ahmadis but was also politically savvy and so awarded Salam the Nishan-i-Imtiaz in 1980. Then things started changing. Benazir Bhutto stayed totally clear of Salam and so did Mian Nawaz Sharif. During his first tenure as prime minister, while speaking at Government College Lahore in 1992, Nawaz Sharif read out a long list of distinguished alumni and faculty but conspicuously omitted Salam’s name. Quite miraculously, Nawaz Sharif eventually recognised Salam’s importance as a scientist. While touring CERN (European Nuclear Research Centre) in 2016 to cement the Pak-CERN collaboration, one hears he was much impressed to learn that major parts of CERN’s research — including the successful search for the Higgs boson — revolved around certain discoveries of Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg. He was also taken for a drive on Rue de Salam, a road in Geneva named after Salam. It was but natural that someone should then have asked Pakistan’s prime minister a basic question: why did Salam’s home country have no significant institution named after him? The natural candidate was the National Centre for Physics located on the campus of Quaid-i-Azam University, a public university. NCP was conceived in the 1980s jointly by Salam and his former PhD student Riazuddin (1930-2013), a respected theoretical physicist who also became NCP’s founding director. Though hopelessly underfunded, it started off in 1999 on borrowed premises on the QAU campus. NCP’s original goal was to become a mini ICTP (International Centre for Theoretical Physics). Founded by Salam in the Italian city of Trieste, the ICTP (now renamed Abdus Salam-ICTP) has hosted thousands of researchers from around the world to work in a cordial and intellectually vibrant atmosphere on cutting-edge scientific problems. It is an established model for international cooperation and the openness of scientific inquiry. Days after Salam’s 20th death anniversary, the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif moved to change NCP’s name. He failed. To remind readers of how that happened, I will repeat some details from my Dawn article of 2018. On Dec 29, 2016, the president of Pakistan, on the summary advice of the prime minister of Pakistan, put his signature upon a document titled, Proposal to Rename NCP at QAU as Professor Abdus Salam Centre for Physics. Earlier, the summary had been vetted on Dec 26, 2016, by the minister of state for education and professional training. It was then sent to QAU for necessary action as per proper procedure. The official order for renaming NCP — duly signed by the Pakistani state’s highest executives, both the president and the prime minister — was received at QAU and conveyed onward to NCP. It was ignored. For a modern state to have subordinate officials deliberately and openly defying lawful authority is rare but this is precisely what happened. Direct orders from the sitting prime minister and president went into the wastebasket and NCP’s name remained unchanged. Religious prejudice was just too deep. I think what the political leadership did not fully understand was how much the character of NCP had changed. Now funded by the Strategic Plans Division of the Pakistan Army, NCP is a parking lot for retired officers from high security institutions. Living the good life in plush residences at the foot of the Margalla Hills, they are answerable only to themselves and not to any government. In a fortress bristling with barbed wire and armed guards, no high-thinking physicist pondering on the nature of the universe is likely to be found there. Once again Salam had been cheated of the respect he deserves for his scientific work. He may be the starkest example but is not alone. Pakistan does not own any son of the soil who happens to be a non-Muslim. Har Gobind Khorana (1922-2011) was born in Multan, earned his MSc degree from Government College Lahore in 1946 and went on to earn the Nobel Prize in physiology in 1968 for his work in protein synthesis via nucleotides. In 1983 another Lahori, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995), became a Nobel Laureate in physics after his definitive work on the death of stars. Nasa’s satellite, named Chandra, is presently searching the skies for black holes and other astronomical objects. Prejudice poisons the well of knowledge, making its water too toxic for science and inquiry to grow. As with Salam, nothing in Lahore acknowledges the existence of either Khorana or Chandrasekhar. Nevertheless they must still be considered fortunate. At least they have been spared the abuse and vilification that the long-dead Salam must continue to endure.",negative
"PETRO-GIANT countries of the Arab world may not be terribly well known for perspicacious scholarship or prowess in scientific research but their one-upmanship knows no limits. The United Arab Emirates is presently stealing the show: the Emirates Mars Mission’s successful July 2020 launch means it will rendezvous with the Red Planet in six months; UAE cities have spectacular skylines premiering the worlds’ tallest and most stunning buildings; and the world’s top airline is called Emirates. There’s every kind of futuristic gimmickry: the world’s first minister of artificial intelligence, 27-year-old Sultan Al Olama, was just appointed under UAE’s Centennial 2071 plan. Close on UAE’s heels are other GCC countries with Saudi Arabia having started the construction of Neom, a futuristic megacity deep in the desert bordering the Red Sea. Costing $500 billion upward, it will feature artificial rain, a fake moon, robotic maids, flying taxis, and holographic teachers. Qatar plans to spend over $220bn while hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Twelve solar-cooled super-stadiums holding around 50,000 spectators each are nearing completion. Private scorn accompanies these humongous public spectacles. What’s Arab about all this? Expats flown in from around the globe run the show. They range from domestic servants to truck drivers and from famous architects to top-of-the-line space-travel engineers. The relationship is purely transactional: petrodollars buy brains, brawn and gadgets. Arab and Pakistani cultures remain self-congratulatory even eight centuries after Islam’s Golden Age ended. But, knowing the oil will eventually dry out, some GCC Arab rulers are realising that theirs is a road to nowhere. Beating the drum of past glories and education of the usual religious kind will doom them to remain consumers and supplicants. And so, at least at first glance, they seem to be doing everything right and are throwing tons of money at it. Education from the primary class to university is free in all state institutions. New Arab universities are aplenty with several US universities having Arab campuses to which famous foreign professors are lured with incredible pay packages. Laboratories are stuffed with scientific equipment and every kind of infrastructure is there for the asking. Is it working? Has a culture of learning and scholarship developed? Nature, a highly respected science journal, has effusive praise. A recent article in its Middle Eastern edition, ‘The Rise of Saudi Arabia as a Science Powerhouse’ describes Saudi Arabia as “West Asia’s second most scientifically productive country after Israel”. Other GCC countries have shot up in world rankings as well. The sole criterion used is the number of research papers published from universities. But with 20 different ways of getting your name onto a paper in the internet age, and with foreign visitors flown in just for lending their prestigious names to a paper, making large claims based upon small evidence is unwise. Nature’s normal objectivity was likely influenced by political and financial considerations. The astonishing conclusion of “science powerhouse” is unsupported by other evidence. Unesco’s Science Report, for example, was far more cautious. It observed that in most Arab countries, “the education system is still not turning out graduates who are motivated to contribute to a healthier economy”. University professors returning from teaching stints in GCC countries agree. They complain about the indifference, apathy, poor work ethic, and lack of curiosity among their students. Reading habits are undeveloped. Most students opt for ‘soft’ areas like marketing, banking and management with few going for more intellectually demanding and rigorous disciplines. At the heart of this is Arab attitudes towards knowledge and learning. Centuries after the end of Islam’s Golden Age (9th to 13th centuries), Arab culture is self-absorbed and centred on self-congratulation. Convinced that it possesses the only true religion and that Arabic is the most perfect language, it claims eternal monopoly over truth. That’s narcissism on a civilisational scale. Narcissus, as the reader knows, is a Greek legendary figure who fell deliriously in love with himself and disdained all around him. In anger the goddess Nemesis punished him by obsessing him with his reflection in the stream. So lovely was the bloom of his youth that he could not walk away from himself. And so Narcissus wasted away and died. A similar tragedy befalls cultures lost in self-love. They lose vitality because there is little desire to interact and mingle with other peoples or to move with the times. Many young Arabs today take this lazy route. They disdain intellectual pursuits, thinking that modern accomplishments are only a pale reflection of the foundational works of their Muslim ancestors. This is delusionary. Science and learning came from all humankind and existed in civilisations long preceding Islam. Ancient Babylonian and Egyptian science started 3,000 to 4,000 years ago and the Chinese, Indian and Greek civilisations were extremely fertile as well. Relatively speaking, science in Islam was a latecomer that began with the translation of Greek works about 150 years after the death of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). Muslims added many new and brilliant ideas but their science is just one part of pre-modern science. Some signs of hope are finally emerging in the Arab world. The abject failure to modernise — except very superficially — is making GCC countries realise that insularity won’t work. Several are moving up the learning curve and absorbing universal values by allowing wider media access and more personal freedoms for citizens, particularly for women. While the trend towards recognising Netanyahu’s Israel smacks of defeatism and sells out Palestinian interests, the decrease in anti-Semitic propaganda augurs well for all. Bucking progressive trends in the Arab world, Pakistan is busy manufacturing new narcissistic illusions. Lacking the will to address urban chaos (as in Karachi) or to generate significant employment, it seeks solace through concocting a Turkic-Islamic past and heaping adoration upon the fictionalised Ertugrul drama series. Now watched daily by millions, it is a new form of escapism. Evidence for a further closing of the Pakistani mind is starkly visible. Absent from our school curriculum is the study of world history, philosophy, epistemology, or comparative religions. In PTI’s Single National Curriculum, rote learning has massively increased, as has religious content. The brains of our schoolchildren are being programmed for a world other than the one they live in.",negative
"BE prepared, Pakistan! Imran Khan’s government is poised to inflict damage upon this country’s education system in a manner never seen before. Its so-called Single National Curriculum (SNC) hides systemic changes going far deeper than the ones conceived and executed by the extremist regime of Gen Ziaul Haq. Implementation is scheduled for 2021. At first glance a uniform national curriculum is hugely attractive. Some see it striking a lethal blow at the abominable education apartheid that has wracked Pakistan from day one. By the year, a widening gap has separated beneficiaries of elite private education from those crippled by bad public schooling. So what could be better than the rich child and the poor child studying the same subjects from the same books and being judged by the same standards? But this morally attractive idea has been hijacked, corrupted, mutilated and beaten out of shape by those near-sighted persons now holding Pakistan’s future in their hands, and who, like their boss, kowtow to the madressah establishment. Prime Minister Khan was widely criticised in 2016-17 for making huge grants to madressahs of the late Maulana Samiul Haq, self-professed father of the Taliban who was murdered by an associate in mysterious circumstances. The SNC massively prioritises ideology over education quality and acquisition of basic skills. As yet only SNC plans for Class I-V are public. But the huge volume of religious material they contain beats all curriculums in Pakistan’s history. A column-by-column comparison with two major madressah systems — Tanzeemul Madaris and Rabtaul Madaris — reveals a shocking fact. Ordinary schools will henceforth impose more rote learning than even these madressahs. Normal schoolteachers being under-equipped religiously, SNC calls for summoning an army of madressah-educated holy men — hafiz’s and qaris — as paid teachers inside schools. How this will affect the general ambiance and the safety of students is an open question. The push for a uniform national curriculum idea derives from three flawed assumptions: First: It is false that quality differences between Pakistan’s various education streams stem from pursuing different curricula. When teaching any secular subject such as geography, social studies or science, all streams have to cover the same topics. While details and emphases obviously differ, each must deal with exactly seven continents and water being H2O. Instead, learning differentials arise because students experience very different teaching methods and are evaluated using entirely different criteria. So, for example, a local examination board will typically ask a mathematics student to name the inventor of logarithms whereas an ‘O’-level student must actually use logarithms to solve some problem. The modern world expects students to reason their way through a question, not parrot facts. Second: It is false that a hefty dose of piety will somehow equalise students of Aitchison College and your run-of-the-mill neighbourhood school. The legendary Mahmood and Ayyaz prayed in the same suff (prayer line) and established a commonality without ending their master-slave relationship. Similarly, rich and poor schools will remain worlds apart unless equalised through school infrastructure, well-trained teachers, high quality textbooks and internet access. How the needed resources will be generated is anybody’s guess. Under the PTI, defence is the only sector seeing increases instead of cuts. Third: It is false that school systems belonging to the modern world can be brought onto the same page as madressahs. Modern education rests squarely upon critical thinking, and success/failure is determined in relation to problem solving and worldly knowledge. Madressah education goals are important but different. They seek a more religiously observant student and a better life after death. Understandably, critical thinking is unwelcome. While some madressahs now teach secular subjects like English, science and computers, this comes after much arm-twisting. Soon after 9/11, madressahs were spotlighted as terrorist breeding grounds. Musharraf’s government, beholden as it was to America, ordered them to teach secular subjects. Most rejected this outright but others were successfully pressurised. However, madressahs teach secular and religious subjects identically; reasoning is sparse and authoritarianism dominates. While the new Class I-V SNC document also discusses secular subjects, much of this is pointless tinkering with the minutiae of teaching English, general knowledge, general science, mathematics and social studies. They are not accompanied by plausible plans for how the necessary intellectual or physical resources will be garnered and the plans implemented. Still bigger changes are around the corner. The Punjab government has made teaching of the Holy Quran compulsory at the college and university level. Without passing the required examination no student will be able to get a BA, BSc, BE, ME, MA, MSc, MPhil, PhD or medical degree. Even the Zia regime did not have such blanket requirements. To get a university teaching job in the 1980s, you had to name all the wives of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and recite some difficult religious passages such as Dua-i-Qunoot. Still, students could get degrees without that. That option is now closed. Starkly inferior to their counterparts in Iran, India and Bangladesh, Pakistani students perform poorly in all international science and mathematics competitions. Better achievers are invariably from the elite ‘O’-/‘A’-level stream. More worrying is that most students are unable to express themselves coherently and grammatically in any language, whether Urdu or English. They have stopped reading books. Significantly, as yet the PTI’s new education regime is mum on how it will advance its goal of closing a huge skill deficit. So poor is the present quality of technical and vocational institutes that private employers must totally retrain the graduates. That’s why private-sector industrial growth is small and entire state enterprises, such as PIA and Pakistan Steel Mills, have collapsed. Pakistan’s space programme flopped but Iran has just put a military satellite into orbit and India is well on the way to Mars. Empowered by the 18th Amendment, Pakistan’s provinces should vigorously resist the regressive plan being thrust upon the nation by ideologues that have usurped power in Islamabad. Else Pakistan will end up as the laughing stock of South Asia, left behind even by Arab countries. Pakistan’s greatest need — and its single greatest failure — is its tragic failure to impart essential life skills to its citizens. To move ahead, the priority should be to educate rather than score political points.",negative
"ON July 29, Narendra Modi’s government unveiled what it calls a groundbreaking new national education policy (NEP 2020). The 65-page document’s wide range — from primary to university — forces me to consider here just a single issue: To what extent does NEP reflect the BJP ideology of Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan? And how does it compare against Pakistan’s newly declared single national curriculum with logo: one nation, one curriculum? At face value NEP is innocuous, even charming. It speaks of India’s rich heritage, the ancient universities of Nalanda and Takshashila, mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya and Brahmagupta, jnan (knowledge) and satya (truth) etc. The goal of education is: “complete realisation and liberation of the self”. Who can possibly object? Still better: my computer word search yielded only two occurrences of the word ‘religion’, both times in the harmless context of NEP’s purported inclusion of all religions. NEP also engages our anti-colonial sensibilities: Indian children up to grade 6-7 can learn English if they want but, under its new three-language formula, states and regions can choose their languages provided at least two of the three are native to India. In principle Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, and Christian students will use the same books, study side by side in the same classrooms, and take the same exams. Wonderful! But inside NEP’s not-so-hidden agenda are the clear wishes of RSS, the BJP’s ideological parent. RSS follows its guru, M.S. Golwalkar, who suggested India learn from Hitler in keeping races pure. In 1947, RSS wanted all Muslims remaining in India expelled to Pakistan. Then a minority, it now enjoys full state support. India must look towards its glorious past, declares NEP, with that past exclusively Hindu. Although Sanskrit is a culturally dead language, NEP calls it the fount of all sacred and secular knowledge. Urdu, on the other hand, although spoken by tens of millions of Indians and once the language of the Bombay film industry, is absent from a list that includes Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia, Pali, Persian, and Prakrit. India and Pakistan’s new education policies will push their respective religious minorities into a corner All education policies are cooking recipes; the final product depends upon ingredients. NEP hints at, but leaves unspecified, what textbooks will contain. Will history be dispassionately presented as a series of invasions which, layer by layer, built Indian culture over the millennia? Or are Muslims merely wicked temple-destroyers who shattered the seraphic heaven of Mother India? One worries because in BJP-ruled states, leaders have demanded removal of references to Mughal emperors Akbar and Aurangzeb to make space for Hindu kings like Maharana Pratap and Shivaji. Interestingly, RSS’s nativism appears driven more by its anti-Christian agenda than its anti-Muslim one. Since the days of Lord Macaulay, convents and other English-medium Christian missionary schools have been the mainstay of modern Indian education. But today, tens of thousands of RSS-associated vernacular language schools stand against them. These will gain from downgrading English. RSS pracharaks are jubilant but Indians face a reality check. English-medium schools, not traditional patshalas and gurukuls, modernised India and gave it global clout. While India can name its satellite ‘Aryabhatta’, Isaac Newton’s laws actually guided it into orbit. Even the BJP minister whose signature is on NEP, Prakash Javedekar, knows this. From Indian press reports I found that he, along with nine other BJP ministers, has also sent his children to study abroad. NEP is a step backward for India’s national integration. In spite of 30 languages, 130 dialects, and well over a dozen faiths, India took barely 50 years to create a national identity after Jawaharlal Nehru set it on a secular track. Most Muslims, Sikhs and Christians were then proud to declare themselves Indian. But, as Indian secularism retreats, this is now disappearing. Pakistan’s new education policy, only parts of which are known so far, is much more upfront on creating a religion-based society. The goal is to put madressahs at the same level as all other kinds of schools. Henceforth, bearded men from the Ittehad Tanzimat-i-Madaris (Coalition of Madressah Organisers) will decide what Pakistani children will learn and will also scrutinise their textbooks. Religious materials are mandatory from nursery classes onward. The new Class 1-5 curriculum is extremely detailed and reveals more religious content to be memorised than even madressahs require. Discrimination is automatic. Since non-Muslim students cannot be allowed to study from the Holy Book, they must be separated. Major changes are afoot at higher levels as well. The governor of Punjab, Ghulam Sarwar, told me during an exclusive one-on-one meeting in his office on July 23 of his decision to make the award of all university degrees in Punjab contingent upon studying the Holy Quran together with translation. Doing so, he said, will ensure that our university students learn Arabic. He did not elaborate on how this would help make better doctors, economists, engineers, or scientists. For building national identity Pakistan seeks to Arabicise and Islamise whereas India wants to indigenise and Hinduise. The BJP’s way is more subtle than Pakistan’s but cleverer because it understands the enormous power of culture. Programmes such as ‘Aik Bharat Shreshtha Bharat’ aim at developing a multilingual, multicultural (but not multi-religious) Indian national identity. Compare that with education policies in Pakistan where regional cultures and languages find only fleeting references. With no lessons learnt from 1971, Pakistan still assumes that solidifying its Islamic identity will somehow create national integration. Even something as mild as the 18th Amendment, which entrusts education to the provinces, has the sword of Damocles hanging over it. The new education policies of India and Pakistan will further divide them, both from each other as well as within each country. Majoritarian consensus against their respective religious minorities will be hugely strengthened. The Indian policy is milder in tone than Pakistan’s but is probably more dangerous simply because it is better thought out and professionally formulated, hence, likely to be more successful when implemented. On the other hand, the Pakistani policy document is half-baked, wrapped in multiple layers of confusion, and will almost certainly flounder. But if it is implemented, it will lead to fasaadi extremism of a kind that operations like Radul Fasaad cannot ever defeat.",negative
"WINSTON Churchill was a terrible man. He authorised use of chemical weapons against Afghans and Kurds, called China “a barbaric nation”, spoke of the “great hordes of Islam” and wrote of Indians as “a beastly people with a beastly religion”. When informed of mass deaths in the 1943 Bengal famine, he simply asked: “So is Gandhi dead yet?” Those nostalgic for the Raj love him, as do white supremacists. Zionists adore him for what he told the Palestine Royal Commission in 1937: “I do not agree that the dog in a manger has the final right to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time. I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.” Unsurprisingly, Churchill’s statue is iconic for leftists and progressives around the world. Galvanised by the killing of George Floyd, they want not just this statue gone but all historical monuments associated with oppression, slavery, and bigotry to be eliminated from public view. Thoroughly decent people are roaring: pull them down! But stop! This is terribly dangerous. Step back and reflect upon the consequences. I’ve dwelt on Churchill here because he is a metaphor for countless racist, supremacist leaders who led wars of conquest and plundered treasures. From Alexander the Great to Chandragupta Maurya, and Mohammed bin Qasim to Napoleon Bonaparte, ambitious conquerors subjugated weaker peoples on various pretexts. So shouldn’t we eliminate hurtful memories? Left-liberals in the West should ponder the effects of effacing historical symbols as Pakistan-India have. Let’s begin by bulldozing the pyramids of ancient Egypt. They are symbols of extreme oppression and the word ‘pharaoh’ is synonymous with cruelty. Thousands of slaves toiling in the scorching desert sun built tombs for the pharaoh king. When he died his retainers were obliged to collectively commit suicide and be buried in the same pyramid, ready to serve when he awakes in the after-life. Morally, the pyramids ought to be levelled. And what to make of Babri mosque? For Hindu zealots it was the symbol of cultural oppression by Muslim invaders. In 1992 with bare hands and pick-axes a maddened crowd tore apart a five-centuries-old structure built by Emperor Babar, allegedly on the very site where Lord Ram was born. India has never recovered from that. More Muslim heritage lies in the cross hairs. ‘Babar ki auladain’ (sons of Babur) is the pejorative name given to about two dozen or so Indian cities. In time Ahmadabad, Karimnagar, Jamalpur, Faridpur, Hajipur, Moradabad, and Secunderabad might disappear from the map of India and emerge reincarnated with Hindu names. Where will the madness stop? Should the Taj Mahal also be torn down because it marks the extraordinary success of invaders? Of course, the Taj is a horrific example of the abuse of man by man much as the magnificent cathedrals of Europe are. Resources to build monuments were forcibly extracted from toiling peasants. The Taj is just the whim of a ruthless monarch mourning his favourite wife. But look at the Taj in the moonlight and you see something even more enchanting than an architectural jewel. One can almost feel the soft emanations from the side-by-side graves of two star-crossed lovers. Life is surely complex, filled with nuances. My vote: preserve and protect the Taj. Pakistan’s cultural vandalism exceeds India’s. Hindu heritage sites in Pakistan have all but vanished, and Buddhist statues and artifacts wilfully plundered and destroyed. Hardly a tear was shed in Pakistan when the Taliban blew up the 2,000-year old Buddhas in Afghanistan’s Bamiyan province. Deemed as corrupting Hindu influences, the celebration of cultural events such as Baisakhi and Basant, as well as kite flying, have been gradually forbidden or abandoned in recent decades. Even ‘Hindu trees’ like banyan, neem, and pipal have been punished — far fewer can be seen today in comparison to earlier times. I cannot forget the smouldering remains of a 200-year-old graceful banyan in the posh E-7 area of Islamabad, destroyed by students from a nearby madressah as a Hindu symbol. I urge my iconoclastic liberal/left friends in the West to learn from Pakistan-India. In seeking purification by removing distasteful symbols of the past they risk cultural and aesthetic desertification. Pictures of pre-Partition Karachi and Lahore tell us how visually rich and architecturally beautiful they once were — and how cultural purification reduced them to boring blandness. Eliminating symbols does nothing of substance. There was mass euphoria when crowds of Iraqis, helped by US marines with a 50-ton armoured vehicle, toppled a massive Saddam Hussein statue located exactly where the ousted tyrant had destroyed an older monument. But this was no new dawn for the people of Iraq. On the contrary, a decade of bitter Shia-Sunni sectarian warfare ensued. Those who seek to efface history’s markers are merely self-righteous. Those seeking a pure, authentic past untainted by sin are chasing a phantom — it doesn’t exist. In my last Dawn op-ed (‘Dangerous delusions’) I wrote of the psychedelic substance being dished out to Pakistan’s masses every evening in the form of Ertugrul Ghazi and of the dangerous hallucinations it is inducing. Spaceship Earth hurtles towards an uncertain future with a crew that’s terribly sick, more mentally and psychologically than physically. The doctors on board must record the history of various quarrelling groups professionally and clinically, all without emotion or embellishment. The naïve notion of heroes and villains must be dumped; history has actors only. Let Churchill stay. That fat, cigar-smoking, racist Englishman cannot hurt anyone now that worms have eaten away his flesh. Instead, let’s get serious. The starting point must be the realisation that widow burning, slavery, and genocide are as much part of the human condition as are great acts of generosity and compassion. Every civilisation is the legacy of wars, conquests, and brutality. Even the cleverest surgery cannot cut out these bitter legacies without killing the patient.",negative
"A TURKISH drama series brimming with tribal intrigues, blood, murder, and conquest — all wrapped in pious religious idiom — has taken Pakistan by storm. Filmed in Anatolia, Dirilis: Ertugrul is a 150-episode fictional account of Ertugrul Ghazi, father of the Ottoman Empire’s founder. As of yesterday (Friday), the YouTube count for the 30th Urdu-dubbed episode had already clocked up 5.5 million views on Pakistan Television. Even those who made Dirilis are astonished — and hugely pleased — at its tumultuous welcome. Tribal Turkmen fighting for a homeland can’t be expected to capture the imagination of millions in some far-off country. But Pakistan is different. Transfixed, entire families are spending evenings watching it together. They think it is wholesome entertainment and genuine Islamic history. What history? This is a free-wheeling caricature of 13th-century Anatolia of which we know next to nothing. Facts are not important, says Mehmet Bozdag, the man who wrote and produced the series. To quote: “There is very little information about the period we are presenting — not exceeding 4-5 pages. Even the names are different in every source. The first works written about the establishment of the Ottoman State were about 100-150 years later. There is no certainty in this historical data… we are shaping a story by dreaming.” That this serial is frankly propagandistic and ideologically motivated is beyond doubt. It has been manufactured for a purpose. But what purpose? Faked history fuels revivalist dreams, creates false hopes, & suggests the way forward is through the sword. If it seeks to project Islam as a religion of peace and to counter Islamophobia, then the very opposite is achieved. The first scene of the first episode begins with sword-making and sword-sharpening in the background of nomadic tents. The tribe’s adversaries are Christians and Byzantines whose bloodied bodies lie scattered here and there after every fight. The hero, Ertugrul Ghazi, not only beheads several Knight Templars but also former associates from his tribe, such as Kurdoglu Bey, who he suspects of disloyalty. Should we be surprised if IS-like organisations find this inspirational? Is glorifying the sword glorifying Islam? Islam can surely be represented in ways more positive than putting a spotlight on power struggles within a tribal society. Far better, for example, would be to build upon Turkish scholars like Ali Qushgi, Taqi-al-Din, or Al-Jazari. Without Islam’s early scholars the colorful tapestry of Muslim culture — and Turkish culture as well — would have been far poorer, its claim to being a great world civilisation weak and unconvincing. I suspect Dirilis’s real goal is less about Islam and more to vent Turkish nostalgia for a long-lost empire. Production demanded massive funding by the Turkish state. A horse farm was created, together with a special zoo-like area for the sheep, goats, nightingales and partridges that appear on the show. A Hollywood stunt team was hired to train actors for the movie’s staged fights. Erdogan and his family have repeatedly visited the filming site. Understandably, from within the bastions of Sunni Islam the reaction to this blockbuster has been fiercely negative. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have condemned and banned the series, and Egyptian authorities have issued a fatwa decrying this “insidious attempt to re-impose Turkish tutelage” over Arab countries formerly under Ottoman rule. Currently, Saudi Arabia is reportedly funding a $40m counter series called Malik-e-Nar of which trailers have already been produced. Though inadequate it does make the point: Arabs cannot celebrate Turkish imperialism. Most peoples don’t like invaders, but Pakistan’s psyche is somehow special. Perhaps overwhelmed by Erdogan’s aggressive style, Prime Minister Khan proudly tweeted that Turks had ruled India for 600 years. Historians will raise their eyebrows — this is between quarter-true to half-true only. But it must be rare for a prime minister to hail imperial rule over his land. Khan is not alone. Pakistan celebrates all post-eighth century invasions beginning with Mohammed bin Qasim’s conquest of Sindh in 712 AD. Urdu novelist Nasim Hijazi’s books, devoured by millions, are an ode to the Arab conquest of India. Like filmmaker Mehmet Bozdag, Hijazi’s strength lay in creating imagery unconstrained by facts. How should one look at ancient invasions and imperial conquests? To laud or vilify them is equally irrational. India is a stunningly clear example of just how much a society can degenerate if it does that. Hindu revivalism is fixated upon the wicked foreign invader who shattered the seraphic heaven of Mother India. Suddenly all Muslims and Christians became unwelcome. As Narendra Modi’s right-hand man recently declared, foreigners are termites infesting a poor man’s grain store. But do Hindutva’s mindless ideologues not know that all human civilisation began in Africa and there is no such thing as son of Indian soil? That every single human society on earth today is the result of countless conflicts, wars, and foreign invasions over tens of thousands of years? That even precision DNA tests cannot tell the difference between Hindus and Muslims? These basic lessons are for all, not just Pakistan’s rulers. A mature attitude towards ancient foreign invasions would be to simply accept them clinically as facts of history. They should be investigated and absorbed without either glorification or condemnation. Doing otherwise is utterly pointless. No one living today can be held responsible for the actions, good or bad, of his or her ancestors. Moreover the mists of time have forever hidden true facts from view. The creators of Dirilis: Ertugrul want us to wallow in the past glories of others and celebrate imperialism. Hook, line and sinker, we are mindlessly swallowing their proffered bait. This poisonous substance can only reinforce the dangerous delusion that going forward actually means going backward. Instead, the way forward is to ask that Pakistaniat spring from Pakistan’s native soil. It must be rooted in the diversity of all our peoples and historically formed cultures. The year 1971 showed decisively the limits of pan-Islamism. Aping Saudi culture failed to create a viable Pakistani identity; aping Turkey won’t get us much further. Instead a strong national identity can emerge only if Pakistan embraces pluralism, accepts that Punjab is just another Pakistani province, and helps all citizens achieve a sense of belonging based upon a commitment to equality and justice.",negative
"THE powerful loudspeakers of my neighbourhood mosque have just announced a death. The introductory words never change: “Hazraat, aik zaroori ailaan sunyeh” (respectable sirs, hear now an important announcement). The ‘sirs’ doesn’t surprise because I’ve heard such announcements all my life. It’s always men — and only men — who need to be informed of any significant happening. Lest ‘haya’ (modesty or propriety) be violated, women cannot be addressed directly. The rest follows a well-established pattern. Had the deceased been a man, I certainly would have learned his name. But this time it was a woman and haya required she remain unnamed; indeed, the later part of the announcement identified her as somebody’s wife. If unmarried, it wouldn’t be different except that she would be joined to either her father or a brother. Mothers and sisters don’t count. To see where women stand in the pecking order, I suggest the reader tour any graveyard. You will walk past hundreds, perhaps thousands, of stories now silenced. In these sombre environs, every tombstone marks the final resting place of some individual. Their inscriptions record the passage of someone who shall never stir again. Though six feet under, all males hold on to the name they used along their life’s journey. The male’s identity has been literally etched into stone — a stone that’s expected to stay. Sometimes the father’s name appears as well but, of course, never the mother’s. To see where a woman stands in the social order just walk through a cemetery and read the gravestones. And the female? Some tombstones do carry her name but many do not. Whether the end of the woman’s journey shall be marked or remain unmarked is not for her to decide. That too is up to some man, or possibly men. Even if named, she is invariably identified as somebody’s wife or as her father’s daughter. Not all women lament their marginalisation or resent loss of control over their bodies. On the contrary, many accept it either stoically or gladly. But some, such as the female militants of Lal Masjid’s haya brigade, actually celebrate their inferior status in the society. During last Sunday’s Aurat March, as we stood on opposite sides of the Islamabad Press Club, I listened closely to their speeches. For them men and women have separate, non-overlapping roles. They have willingly accepted a status lower than men’s in all crucial aspects of life — freedom of movement, freedom of dress, freedom of association, and freedom to seek employment. This lack of freedom stares you in the face all across our society but even more in poorer sections. The majority of Pakistan’s young women cannot choose their life partners and, instead, are ‘given away’ by their parents. Divorce and child custody overwhelmingly favour the man over the woman. Nor is marital rape recognised as an offence. Inheritance laws are sharply skewed against women, as are employment opportunities. Nevertheless, for the haya brigade and supporters, restricting a woman’s freedom is both natural and divinely ordained — and hence to be welcomed. People who value freedom find the haya brigade’s position unacceptable but actually it is quite logical. Countless examples exist where individuals have voluntarily traded their freedom for security. Notably, prisoners released from jails have sometimes pleaded to be taken back. Or, as another example, after slavery was declared illegal in America, many black slaves petitioned their white owners to keep them on the plantations. So, if jailors and slave owners can provide more security than the wilderness, then why not? More to the point: whenever a woman accepts patriarchy in exchange for lessened freedoms she buys security for herself and her children. The erudite Yuval Noah Harari asks in Sapiens why patriarchy has tenaciously weathered political upheavals, social revolutions and economic transformations. Over thousands of years why have there been so few alpha-women like Cleopatra, Indira Gandhi, or Golda Meir? Is the reason lesser muscle power, lack of male aggressive genes, lesser social networking skills? After much discussion Harari concludes: we don’t really know. But, wait! We do know something very important — modernity is corroding patriarchy; laws of the old world are sliding into irrelevancy. For example, the Book of Deuteronomy instructs Christian soldiers that if they “find a beautiful woman” among captives taken in battle then if “you desire to take her, you may”. Notwithstanding this sanction, even staunch Jews and Christians today recoil in horror at the idea of sexual slavery. Instead, gender equality is now the West’s new mantra; even CEOs and presidents dread accusations of gender discrimination. Muslim countries are also rushing to catch up. Even if some decry gender equality as a Western imposition, nevertheless fewer and fewer women remain shuttered in their homes. In spite of deadly opposition from Taliban-like forces, education for girls is expanding in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Although the Pakistan government has pledged to uphold religious values, it refuses passports unless a burqa-clad woman agrees to a mugshot. Just as significantly, though generally banned from visiting cemeteries, you can see more and more women grieving over their loved ones. The stalwarts of patriarchy are trying to stop a battle tank with a musket. It’s not working and so they froth and fume. But technology’s relentless push is also willy-nilly changing them. Remember those weighty scholars who 20 years ago gave fatwas against photographing human faces or depicting humans pictorially? Today they scramble for TV time and gleefully pose for selfies taken with their smartphones! As the old order disintegrates and traditional arguments become manifestly unreasonable, the misogynist stocks up his arsenal with abuse and vilification. Behold the crude assault upon the brave Marvi Sirmed by one of machoism’s prime defenders, the playwright Khalilur Rahman Qamar. And behold the chorus against ‘mera jism meri marzi’, a slogan maliciously misrepresented as women demanding permission to sell their bodies for material and sensual gain. Whether in the graveyard or out in the living world, Pakistan’s women are denied dignity and equality by those who claim to know God’s will. In the struggle for justice they have a long road ahead — longer than in most countries. But time is on the woman’s side. It is for us men to march alongside them.",negative
